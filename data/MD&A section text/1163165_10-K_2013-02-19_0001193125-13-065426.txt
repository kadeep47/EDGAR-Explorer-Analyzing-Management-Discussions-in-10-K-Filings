Due to the separation of the downstream businesses and our intention to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses in 2012, which are reported as discontinued operations, income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips as an independent exploration and production company. The terms earnings and loss as used in Management Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 30 countries. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 16,900 employees worldwide and total assets of $117 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Discontinued Operations On April 30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business ), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our strategic asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in Kashagan and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview As an independent E&P company, we are solely focused on our core business of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our portfolio primarily includes legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; growing North American shale and oil sands businesses; several major international developments; and a global exploration program. Our value proposition to our shareholders is to deliver 32 Table of Contents production and cash margin growth, competitive returns on capital, and a compelling dividend, while keeping our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. We expect to achieve our value proposition through portfolio optimization, investments in high-margin developments, applying technical capability and maintaining financial flexibility. In our first year as an independent E&P company, we achieved production of 1.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), including production from discontinued operations of .05 million BOED; advanced our growth and drilling programs; paid dividends on our common stock of $3.3 billion for the full year; and repurchased 80 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $5.1 billion. In 2012, we also announced plans to raise $8 $10 billion of proceeds from asset dispositions by the end of 2013. As part of this program, we have generated $2.1 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions through December 31, 2012. We have also announced asset sales, expected to close by mid-2013, which will generate approximately $9.6 billion in additional proceeds. In the near-term, we will fund a portion of our capital program with these proceeds. Over the next five years, our investment in high-margin developments should position us to deliver 3 5 percent annual production volume and margin growth, enabling us to fund our capital program organically. Our total capital program is expected to be $15.8 billion in 2013, compared to $15.7 billion in 2012. Excluding Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria, which are reported as discontinued operations, our 2013 capital program is expected to be $15.5 billion, compared to $14.9 billion in 2012. Our investments will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia, as well as exploration opportunities which will build our inventory for the future. Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2012 included the following: Completed the separation of our Downstream business on April 30, 2012, creating two independent energy companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Achieved annual production of 1.58 million BOED, including production from discontinued operations of .05 million BOED, and generated earnings of $7.5 billion. Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 156 percent and year-end proved reserves of 8.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Repurchased 80 million ConocoPhillips shares, representing 6 percent of our outstanding shares. Paid quarterly dividends of 66 cents per share, consistent with pre-separation dividends. Exceeded 100,000 BOED production milestone in the Eagle Ford; continued Bakken activity ramp up. Exceeded 100,000 BOED average production in the Canadian Oil sands in the fourth quarter of 2012. Progressed FCCL expansion with sanction of Christina Lake Phase F and Narrows Lake Phase A. Achieved first oil from the Gumusut Field in Malaysia. Increased deepwater Gulf of Mexico position to 1.7 million acres; continued appraisal drilling. Expect to increase acreage position to 2.0 million acres in the first quarter of 2013. Increased Niobrara acreage position to approximately 130,000 acres; continued drilling and testing of unconventional shale plays. Progressed the Australia Pacific LNG Project with sanction of the second train in early July 2012; secured $8.5 billion project finance facility. Advanced the disposition program with the announcement of agreements to sell Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria, generating approximately $8.5 billion in expected proceeds. Business Environment In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced many challenges which have influenced our operations and profitability, largely due to factors beyond our control, such as the recent financial crisis, geopolitical events or fears thereof, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, and weather-related disruptions. These factors generally influence the supply and demand of crude oil and natural gas. The most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of our 33 Table of Contents operating cash flows into our business is commodity prices. The prices for commodity products are supply- and demand-based and can be very volatile; therefore, to navigate through the volatility, our strategy is to maintain a core portfolio of low-risk, high-return development programs associated with legacy assets, coupled with a portfolio of development opportunities which offer high-margin growth, such as unconventional plays, deepwater and arctic drilling, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Operating and Financial Priorities Important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: Operating safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom. Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2012, our organic reserve replacement was 108 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Disciplined investment approach. We participate in a capital-intensive industry. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on higher-margin liquids plays and limited investment in North American conventional natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we expect a corresponding shift in our production mix. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. 34 Table of Contents Our $15.8 billion capital program includes contributions to FCCL of $0.8 billion. Our capital expenditures and investment budget for 2013, excluding FCCL, is $15.0 billion, compared to actual capital expenditures and investments in 2012 of $15.0 billion. Excluding discontinued operations for Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria, we estimate 2013 capital expenditures and investments will be $14.7 billion, compared to $14.2 billion in 2012. Approximately 10 percent of the 2013 capital budget is expected to be directed toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio; 40 percent is expected to be allocated to exploitation programs in our legacy asset base, which is intended to offset natural decline from these assets; 35 percent is expected to be spent on sanctioned major developments, such as Eldfisk II, Jasmine and APLNG; and 15 percent is planned for our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target both conventional and unconventional plays. Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic holdings. In 2012, we announced plans to sell an additional $8 $10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. During 2012, we sold our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and we further diluted our interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We recently announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan, our Algerian and Nigerian businesses, and certain properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in North Dakota and Montana. Cedar Creek Anticline is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, and the remaining transactions are expected to close by mid-2013, subject to customary governmental approvals. Additionally, in January 2013, we sold our 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan. In 2011, we sold certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada, and we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industry, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 8 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily as a result of major turnaround expenses in Australia, higher operating expenses in the Lower 48 associated with improved production as a result of increased drilling programs, the settlement of environmental claims and other costs related to Bohai Bay, China, and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66. Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. 35 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Commodity prices. Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following table depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Dollars Per Unit 2012 2011 2010 Market Indicators WTI (per barrel) $ 94.16 95.05 79.39 Dated Brent (per barrel) 111.58 111.27 79.47 U.S. Henry Hub first of month (per million British thermal units) 2.79 4.04 4.39 Global oil prices remained relatively flat in 2012, compared to 2011. In 2012, global oil demand grew at approximately the same pace as in 2011, at about 0.9 percent or 800 thousand barrels per day, as the pace of economic expansion moderated due to intentional slowing in China, coupled with fiscal uncertainties in the European Union and the United States. Global oil production rose due to an increase in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and North American production. WTI continued to trade at a discount to Brent throughout 2011 and 2012, mainly due to high inventory levels and excess crude supply in the U.S. Midcontinent market, largely as a result of limited pipeline capacity. Henry Hub natural gas prices decreased 31 percent in 2012, compared with 2011. U.S. natural gas prices were depressed in 2012, mainly due to high inventory levels, a warmer-than-normal winter and sustained production from shale plays. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices in the near- to mid-term. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. As a result, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 30 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. Our realized bitumen price declined 14 percent in 2012. We expect bitumen prices to remain weak in the near-term, until additional heavy refining capacity comes on-line. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; continued delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2012 totaled $1.2 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in Canada; Cedar Creek Anticline in the Lower 48; various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives; and the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Before-tax impairments in 2011 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of our equity 36 Table of Contents investment in NMNG and certain Canadian natural gas properties. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libya period of civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. Outlook Total production for the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be 1.58 million to 1.6 million BOED, including production from discontinued operations of approximately 40,000 BOED. Full-year 2013 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1.475 million to 1.525 million BOED,which is consistent with 2012 production from continuing operations adjusted for dispositions. Segment Analysis We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. The LUKOIL Investment segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation of Phillips 66 and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 37 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Alaska $ 2,276 1,984 1,727 Lower 48 and Latin America 1,029 1,288 1,029 Canada (684 ) 91 2,902 Europe 1,498 1,830 1,703 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,996 3,093 2,153 Other International 359 (377 ) (417) LUKOIL Investment - 239 2,513 Corporate and Other (993 ) (960 ) (1,305) Income from continuing operations $ 7,481 7,188 10,305 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 4 percent in 2012. The increase was mainly due to: Higher gains from asset sales. In 2012, gains from asset dispositions were $1,567 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2011 from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales of $141 million after-tax. Higher LNG and crude oil prices. Lower production taxes, mainly as a result of lower volumes. The benefit from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million. The favorable resolution of pending claims and settlements of $235 million after-tax. These items were partially offset by: Lower volumes, largely due to dispositions and reduced production in China. Lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen prices. Higher operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included pension settlement expenses of $87 million after-tax and separation costs of $84 million after-tax. Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2012 totaled $900 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2011 of $698 million after-tax. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 30 percent in 2011. The decrease was mainly due to: Lower gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales were $141 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2010 of $4,463 million after-tax. The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. Lower production volumes. 38 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by: Higher commodity prices. Commodity price benefits were partly offset by increased production taxes. Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly as a result of lower volumes. Income Statement Analysis 2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 10 percent in 2012, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partly offset by higher LNG prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 54 percent in 2012. The increase primarily resulted from: Improved earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), mainly due to higher LNG prices, partly offset by lower volumes. Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment. Gain on dispositions increased $1,287 million in 2012. Gains in 2012 primarily resulted from the disposition of our Vietnam business, our equity investment in NMNG, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea and our interest in Block 39 in Peru, partly offset by the loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Gains in 2011 mainly consisted of the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares and the disposition of certain properties located in the Lower 48 and Canada, partially offset by the loss on the initial dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. For additional information, see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased 78 percent in 2012, mostly as a result of the favorable resolution of the Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. For additional information, see Note 14 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 15 percent in 2012, largely as a result of lower U.S. natural gas prices, partly offset by higher purchased volumes. Production and operating expenses increased 6 percent in 2012, mostly due to major turnaround expenses at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility and higher operating expenses in the Lower 48. SG&A expenses increased 28 percent in 2012, primarily due to pension settlement expense and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66. Exploration expenses increased 45 percent in 2012, mostly due to the impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project as a result of its indefinite suspension in the first quarter of 2012. Impairments increased 112 percent in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included the $213 million impairment of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project in the first quarter of 2012, the $192 million property impairment related to the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, as well as increases in the asset retirement obligation for various properties mostly located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives. Impairments in 2011 consisted of various North American natural gas properties. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Table of Contents Taxes other than income taxes decreased 11 percent in 2012, mostly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes. Interest and debt expense decreased 26 percent in 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest on projects and lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 14 percent in 2011, mainly due to significantly higher prices for crude oil and higher LNG prices and volumes. Lower crude oil and natural gas volumes partly offset this increase. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 10 percent in 2011. The decrease primarily resulted from the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. This decrease was partially offset by: Earnings from QG3, primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October 2010. Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a $645 million impairment. Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes. Gain on dispositions decreased 93 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, as well as the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878 million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of a portion of our LUKOIL shares, and gains on the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada. Purchased commodities increased 20 percent in 2011, mainly due to higher natural gas prices in Europe. DD&A decreased 15 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011. Impairments increased $240 million in 2011, mostly due to the impairment of various North American natural gas properties in 2011. Taxes other than income taxes increased 43 percent in 2011, mostly due to higher production taxes in Alaska as a result of higher crude oil prices. Interest and debt expense decreased 18 percent in 2011, primarily due to lower average debt levels. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 40 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2012 2011 2010 Average Net Production (1) Crude oil (MBD) (2) 595 622 733 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 156 145 147 Synthetic oil (MBD) - - 12 Bitumen (MBD) 93 67 59 Natural gas (MMCFD) (3) 4,096 4,359 4,465 Total Production (MBOED) (4) 1,527 1,561 1,695 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 105.72 105.52 77.74 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 46.36 55.73 46.00 Synthetic oil (per barrel) - - 77.56 Bitumen (per barrel) 53.91 62.56 53.06 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 5.48 5.80 5.05 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 626 569 649 Leasehold impairment 719 159 241 Dry holes 155 310 235 $ 1,500 1,038 1,125 Excludes discontinued operations.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2012, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia. In 2012, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2011, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48. In 2011, average production decreased 8 percent compared with 2010, mostly as a result of suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and higher unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production. 41 Table of Contents Alaska 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 2,276 1,984 1,727 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 188 200 215 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 16 15 15 Natural gas (MMCFD) 55 61 82 Total Production (MBOED) 213 225 244 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 109.62 105.95 78.65 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.22 4.56 4.62 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2012, Alaska contributed 24 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Our Alaska operations reported earnings of $2,276 million in 2012, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,984 million in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices, lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes, the absence of the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011, and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating expenses. Production averaged 213 MBOED in 2012, a decrease of 5 percent compared with 2011. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower unplanned downtime. 2011 vs. 2010 Alaska earnings were $1,984 million in 2011, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,727 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 benefitted from significantly higher crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production taxes, lower volumes, higher operating expenses, and the $54 million after-tax write-off of the Denali gas pipeline project. Production averaged 225 MBOED in 2011, a decrease of 8 percent compared with 2010. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, somewhat offset by increased drilling activity. 42 Table of Contents Lower 48 and Latin America 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 1,029 1,288 1,029 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 123 94 85 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 85 74 75 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,493 1,556 1,695 Total Production (MBOED) 457 428 442 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 91.67 92.79 73.52 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 35.45 50.55 39.92 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.67 3.99 4.25 During 2012, Lower 48 and Latin America contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 37 percent of our natural gas production. The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states. 2012 vs. 2011 Lower 48 and Latin America operations reported earnings of $1,029 million in 2012, a 20 percent decrease compared with 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of substantially lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production; lower gains from asset dispositions; higher operating expenses and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes. Earnings in 2012 also benefitted from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million, and the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which has been reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. For additional information, see Note 14 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline. In addition, higher unplanned downtime during 2012 partly offset the increase in production. 2011 vs. 2010 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings were $1,288 million in 2011, a 25 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase in 2011 earnings was mainly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, lower natural gas prices, higher dry hole expenses and impairments. Production averaged 428 MBOED in 2011, a 3 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease in 2011 was mainly due to asset dispositions. Normal field decline was offset by new production, mainly from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and Barnett areas, and improved drilling and well performance. 43 Table of Contents Canada 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (684 ) 91 2,902 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 13 12 15 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 24 26 23 Synthetic oil (MBD) - - 12 Bitumen (MBD) Consolidated operations 12 10 10 Equity affiliates 81 57 49 Total bitumen 93 67 59 Natural gas (MMCFD) 857 928 984 Total Production (MBOED) 273 260 273 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 78.26 86.04 67.99 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 48.64 56.84 47.68 Synthetic oil (per barrel) - - 77.56 Bitumen (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 57.58 55.16 51.10 Equity affiliates 53.39 63.93 53.43 Total bitumen 53.91 62.56 53.06 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.13 3.46 3.74 Our Canadian operations are mainly comprised of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2012, Canada contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Canada operations reported a loss of $684 million in 2012, a reduction of $775 million compared with earnings of $91 million in 2011. The decrease in earnings was largely due to significantly lower natural gas prices, lower bitumen prices and higher impairments, mainly as a result of the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher bitumen volumes from FCCL and lower DD&A from our western Canadian gas assets, primarily due to asset dispositions and curtailments. Equity earnings from FCCL were also impacted by higher operating and DD&A expenses, mostly as a result of higher production volumes. Average production in Canada increased 5 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. Normal field decline and the impact from asset dispositions were more than offset by new production from Christina Lake Phases C and D and improved well performance from Foster Creek, both in FCCL. 2011 vs. 2010 Canada earnings were $91 million in 2011, a reduction of $2,811 million compared with 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower gains from asset dispositions. Earnings in 2010 included the $2,679 million after-tax gain realized from the sale of our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation. Lower volumes, mostly as a result of asset dispositions, impairments on various natural gas properties and lower 44 Table of Contents natural gas prices also contributed to the decrease in 2011 earnings. These decreases were somewhat offset by higher bitumen, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices, lower DD&A and lower dry hole expenses. Production averaged 260 MBOED in 2011, a 5 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease was mainly due to asset dispositions and normal field decline, partly offset by new production from FCCL.

In 2012, our Europe operations contributed 17 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 13 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Europe operations reported earnings of $1,498 million in 2012, an 18 percent decrease compared with 2011. The reduction in earnings was mainly due to lower volumes and higher impairments. Earnings for 2012 were also impacted by additional income tax expense due to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in 2012, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. These decreases to earnings were partly offset by a $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields and lower DD&A. Additionally, earnings in 2011 included a $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense due to legislation enacted in 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. Production averaged 228 MBOED in 2012, an 18 percent decrease compared with 2011. The decrease was mostly due to normal field decline, dispositions and higher unplanned downtime in the United Kingdom. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for our Europe operations were $1,830 million in 2011, a 7 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,703 million in 2010. Earnings benefitted from significantly higher prices and lower DD&A, partly offset by lower volumes and the $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense. Earnings in 2010 also benefitted from a $58 million insurance settlement. 45 Table of Contents Production averaged 279 MBOED in 2011, a 20 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease mainly resulted from normal field decline, unplanned downtime and dispositions, somewhat offset by new production from Britannia and J-Block.

During 2012, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 28 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Asia Pacific and Middle East operations reported earnings of $3,996 million in 2012, a 29 percent increase compared with 2011 earnings of $3,093 million. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from higher gains from asset dispositions, significantly higher LNG prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A and operating expenses from QG3, and lower Bohai Bay expenses incurred in 2012. Amounts realized from dispositions in 46 Table of Contents 2012 consisted of a $931 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business and a $133 million after-tax loss recognized on the further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. In 2011, we recognized a $279 million after-tax loss on the initial dilution of our interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. The increase in 2012 earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil volumes, mainly as a result of the Bohai Bay seepage incidents and the Vietnam disposition, lower LNG volumes and higher production taxes. Average production decreased 10 percent in 2012. The decrease was largely due to the disposition of our Vietnam business, normal field decline, planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility in 2012, as well as lower production in China. 2011 vs. 2010 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased 44 percent in 2011, compared with 2010 earnings. The increase was mainly due to higher prices, higher volumes, mostly as a result of a full year of LNG sales from QG3, and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partly offset by higher production taxes, higher operating expenses and the $279 million loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Production averaged 332 MBOED in 2011, a 14 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase was largely due to the ramp-up of production from QG3, partly offset by higher unplanned downtime, mainly in China, and normal field decline. Timor-Leste Arbitration ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax assessments. Between 2010 and 2012, ConocoPhillips has paid, under protest, tax assessments totaling approximately $227 million, which are primarily recorded in the Investments and long-term receivables line on our December 31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The arbitration will be conducted in Singapore under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste Government. The arbitration process is currently underway. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time. 47 Table of Contents Other International 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars)* $ 359 (377 ) (417) Average Net Production* Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 40 8 46 Equity affiliates 13 29 52 Total crude oil 53 37 98 Natural gas (MMCFD) 18 1 8 Total Production (MBOED) 56 37 99 Average Sales Prices* Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 110.75 98.30 79.22 Equity affiliates 96.50 101.62 74.33 Total crude oil 107.56 101.14 76.57 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) 5.55 0.09 0.09 * Prior periods have been restated to exclude discontinued operations. The Other International segment includes producing operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Angola and the Caspian Sea. During 2012, Other International contributed 6 percent of our worldwide liquids production. 2012 vs. 2011 Other International operations reported earnings of $359 million in 2012, a $736 million increase compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in NMNG, the absence of a $395 million after-tax impairment of our investment in NMNG in 2011, and higher earnings from Libya, as a result of the resumption of production following a period of civil unrest in 2011. These increases were partially offset by a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Production averaged 56 MBOED in 2012, a 51 percent increase compared with 2011 production. The increase was mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by field decline in Russia and the disposition of our interest in NMNG. 2011 vs. 2010 Other International reported a loss of $377 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $417 million in 2010. The improvement in 2011 was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A from NMNG and lower impairments. In 2011, we recorded a $395 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG, compared with a $645 million impairment to NMNG recorded in 2010. These improvements in 2011 were partly offset by considerably lower volumes, mainly from Libya and Russia, as well as the absence of a deferred tax benefit recognized in 2010. Production averaged 37 MBOED in 2011, a 63 percent decrease compared with 2010 production. The decrease was mostly due to suspended operations in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and field decline in Russia. 48 Table of Contents Asset Dispositions We recently announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan and our Algerian and Nigerian businesses. The transactions are expected to close by mid-2013, subject to customary governmental approvals. In January 2013, we sold our 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations $ - 239 2,513 This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (648 ) (710 ) (995) Corporate general and administrative expenses (313 ) (190 ) (209) Technology (4 ) 15 (23) Separation costs (84 ) (25 ) - Other 56 (50 ) (78) $ (993 ) (960 ) (1,305) 2012 vs. 2011 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2012, mostly due to higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels, higher interest income and the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the favorable resolution of the PDVSA arbitration. These improvements were partly offset by a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 65 percent in 2012, mainly due to $87 million of after-tax pension settlement expense and higher costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands; unconventional reservoirs; subsurface technology; liquefied natural gas; and arctic, deepwater and sustainability technology. Technology reported a loss of $4 million in 2012, compared to earnings of $15 million in 2011, primarily as a result of lower licensing revenues. 49 Table of Contents Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Separation costs increased $59 million in 2012 and mainly included costs related to compensation and benefit plans. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The improvement in Other in 2012 was largely due to various tax-related adjustments, including a $39 million after-tax settlement. These improvements were partially offset by higher environmental expenses and foreign currency transaction losses. 2011 vs. 2010 Net interest decreased 29 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, as a result of lower average debt levels. In addition, the absence of a $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and the absence of $24 million of after-tax interest expense associated with a tax settlement, both of which occurred in 2010, contributed to the decrease. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2011, mainly due to lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans, partly offset by higher advertising expenses. Technology had earnings of $15 million in 2011, as a result of higher licensing revenues, partially offset by higher project expenses. Separation costs in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs. Changes in the Other category primarily resulted from lower environmental costs and gains from foreign currency transactions, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment. 50 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 13,458 13,953 14,013 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 464 5,693 3,032 Short-term debt 955 1,013 936 Total debt 21,725 22,623 23,592 Total equity 48,427 65,749 69,124 Percent of total debt to capital* 31 % 26 25 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 9 % 10 10 * Capital includes total debt and total equity. ** Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2012, we received $2,132 million in proceeds from asset sales and $1,996 million for the issuance of debt. During 2012, the primary uses of our available cash were $14,172 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $5,098 million to repurchase common stock; $3,278 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $2,565 million to repay debt. During 2012, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,162 million to $3,618 million. In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Separation of Phillips 66 On April 30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, were transferred to Phillips 66. After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April 30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April 16, 2012 (the Record Date), received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date. In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution. These funds will be used solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution. At December 31, 2012, the unused amount of the special cash distribution was $748 million and is designated as Restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2012, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $13,458 million, a 4 percent decrease from 2011. During 2011, cash provided by continuing operations was $13,953 million compared with $14,013 million in 2010. 51 Table of Contents While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our 2012 production from continuing operations averaged 1.527 million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production from continuing operations in 2013 is expected to be 1.475 million to 1.525 million BOED. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2012 was 142 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 156 percent of 2012 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2012, our reserve replacement was 48 percent (including 65 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 108 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. We are pursuing developments we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make development uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2012 were $2,132 million, primarily from the sale of our Vietnam business, the sale of our equity interest in NMNG and the sale of our interest in the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea. This compares with proceeds of $2,192 million in 2011, which mainly included the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL and certain properties located in the Lower 48. We have announced additional asset sales of $9.6 billion which are expected to close by mid-2013. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In May 2012, we decreased our total revolving credit facilities from $8.0 billion to $7.5 billion by terminating all commitments under the $500 million credit facility, which was due to expire in July 2012. At 52 Table of Contents December 31, 2012, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, with no letters of credit issued at December 31, 2012, and $40 million at December 31, 2011. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, $1,055 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2012, compared with $1,128 million at December 31, 2011. Since we had $1,055 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.4 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2012. Our senior long-term debt is rated A1 by Moody Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poor Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral. Cash is the primary source for providing collateral; however, many permit us to post letters of credit. At December 31, 2012, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $852 million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. 53 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 13 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2012, was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $0.9 billion during 2012. During 2012, we repaid notes totaling $2.4 billion. We incurred a before-tax loss on redemption of $79 million, consisting of make-whole premiums and unamortized issuance costs. In December 2012, we issued $2.0 billion of new low-interest notes. We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to FCCL. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007 and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $772 million was short-term and was included in the Accounts payable related parties line on our December 31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $733 million in 2012, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. In February, 2013, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March 1, 2013, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2013. Since our share repurchase programs began in 2010, share repurchases totaled 300 million shares at a cost of $20.1 billion through December 31, 2012. Although we have no current plans for further share repurchases, we may do so opportunistically, contingent upon commodity prices and proceeds from asset dispositions. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2012: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1 Year Years 2-3 Years 4-5 After 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 21,709 955 1,952 3,274 15,528 Capital lease obligations 16 - - - 16 Total debt 21,725 955 1,952 3,274 15,544 Interest on debt and other obligations 16,355 1,247 2,216 1,964 10,928 Operating lease obligations 2,151 477 960 424 290 Purchase obligations (b) 26,465 12,149 4,370 2,242 7,704 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 3,582 772 1,672 1,138 - Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (d) 2,579 484 1,045 1,050 - Asset retirement obligations* 9,033 387 521 413 7,712 Accrued environmental costs 364 38 65 48 213 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 116 116 (e ) (e ) (e) Total $ 82,370 16,625 12,801 10,553 42,391 *Excludes amounts related to discontinued operations: $ 131 - - - 131 (a) Includes $429 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts.

(b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $12,602 million. Purchase obligations of $9,629 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a five-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2013 through 2017. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2017, see Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $756 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. 55 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital Program Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Alaska $ 828 774 729 Lower 48 and Latin America 5,251 3,882 1,790 Canada 2,184 1,761 1,356 Europe 2,860 2,222 1,190 Asia Pacific and Middle East 2,430 2,325 2,157 Other International 415 8 127 LUKOIL Investment - - - Corporate and Other 204 242 186 Capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations 14,172 11,214 7,535 Discontinued operations in Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria 817 1,038 1,071 Joint venture acquisition obligation (principal) Canada 733 695 659 Capital Program $ 15,722 12,947 9,265 Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, totaled $32.9 billion.

Of the $15.0 billion for the capital expenditures and investments budget, $0.3 billion relates to our discontinued operations in Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria and $14.7 billion relates to continuing operations. Included in the 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget is $0.6 billion in capitalized interest. Our 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget for continuing operations of $14.7 billion is 4 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2012. We are directing approximately 60 percent of our 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget for continuing operations to North America. These funds are expected to be directed toward: In Alaska, further development of opportunities in Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk and Alpine fields, and initial development of Point Thomson Field. In Lower 48, development of liquids-rich areas, such as the Eagle Ford trend, and the Williston and Permian basins. Exploration and appraisal activities in the Eagle Ford shale formation, and Avalon, Wolfcamp and Niobrara areas in Lower 48. Appraisal of deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries, wildcat wells and acreage additions. Liquids opportunities in the western Canada basins and Canadian oil sands. Exploration and appraisal activities in Canadian shale plays and oil sands. We are directing approximately 40 percent of our 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget for continuing operations to Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. These funds are expected to be directed toward: Further development of CBM associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, continued development of Bohai Bay in China, new fields offshore Malaysia, and offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. In the North Sea, the Greater Ekofisk Area, development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Block Area, development of Clair Ridge and the Britannia Long Term Compression Project. Onshore developments in Libya. Exploration and appraisal activities in Australia offshore Browse Basin and onshore Canning Basin, deepwater Angola, offshore Indonesia and Malaysia, and the North Sea. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. 57 Table of Contents Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 14 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. 58 Table of Contents These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2011, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 74 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2012, we had closed 2 sites and transferred 61 sites to Phillips 66, bringing the number to 11 unresolved sites with potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state 59 Table of Contents agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $575 million in 2012 and are expected to be about $478 million per year in 2013 and 2014. Capitalized environmental costs were $297 million in 2012 and are expected to be about $459 million per year in 2013 and 2014. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2012, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $364 million, and we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. At December 31, 2011, accrued environmental costs were $922 million, of which $542 million related to the Downstream business. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2012 was approximately $10 million (pre-tax equity share). A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July 1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2012 was approximately $7 million. 60 Table of Contents The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. The EPA announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA and U.S. Department of Transportation joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2012 was approximately $20 million (equity share pre-tax). In October 2012 the Norwegian government announced a doubling of the carbon tax for oil and gas production in 2013. Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which took effect from July 2012. Our annual cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation during the initial fixed price phase is approximately $10 million (equity share pre-tax). In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). The GHG reductions required. The price and availability of offsets. The amount and allocation of allowances. Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. 61 Table of Contents The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. Reducing GHG emissions In 2011 the Company reduced GHG emissions by 600,000 tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. Engaging externally The Company is a sponsor of MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $8 to $46 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 62 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2012, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,915 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $517 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 46 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately four years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2013 would increase by approximately $30 million. At year-end 2012, the remaining $6,576 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. These major assets are not expected to move to proved properties in 2013. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 63 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2012, total suspended well costs were $1,038 million, compared with $1,037 million at year-end 2011. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income 64 Table of Contents statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2012, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $55 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2012 was approximately $6.4 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011 and 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2012. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2012 would have increased by an estimated $336 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other 65 Table of Contents compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. 66 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices. Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen and LNG. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism or cyber attacks.
