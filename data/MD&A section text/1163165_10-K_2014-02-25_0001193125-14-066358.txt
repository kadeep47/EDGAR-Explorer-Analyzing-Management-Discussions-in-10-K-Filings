Due to discontinued operations reporting, as more fully described below, income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips earnings. The terms earnings and loss as used in Management Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18,400 employees worldwide and total assets of $118 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Discontinued Operations On April 30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business ), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and the sale of our Algeria business, and we have agreements to sell our Nigeria business. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 3 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview We are an independent E&P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our asset base reflects our legacy as a major company with a strategic focus on higher-margin developments. Our diverse portfolio includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Our value proposition to our shareholders is to deliver production and cash margin growth, competitive returns on capital, and a compelling dividend, while keeping our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. We expect to achieve this value proposition through optimizing our portfolio, investing in high-margin developments, applying technical capability and maintaining financial flexibility. 35 Table of Contents We achieved several strategic milestones in 2013. We delivered on our non-core asset sales, advanced our growth programs, achieved exploration success and increased shareholder distributions. These accomplishments will position us to meet our goal of 3 to 5 percent annual production and margin growth beginning in 2014. During 2013, we generated $15.8 billion in cash from continuing operations, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.3 billion and generated $10.2 billion in proceeds from dispositions of non-core assets. This brings the total proceeds received to $12.4 billion for the 2012 2013 program, which has exceeded our goal of raising $8 $10 billion in proceeds from disposition of non-strategic assets during 2012 and 2013. Consistent with our commitment to offer our shareholders a compelling dividend, in July 2013, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 4.5 percent to $0.69 per share. In 2013, we achieved production of 1,545 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), including production from discontinued operations of 43 MBOED. With the startup of major projects at Christina Lake Phase E, Ekofisk South and Jasmine in 2013, final preparations underway for full-field startup at Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai, and a portfolio of high-margin opportunities, we have the momentum to begin delivering our volume growth goals in 2014. We funded a $16.9 billion capital program in 2013 and fully prepaid a $2.8 billion joint venture acquisition obligation to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. Our 2013 capital program yielded a strong organic reserve replacement, as our annual organic reserve replacement ratio was 179 percent. The organic reserve additions represent a continuing portfolio shift to higher-value liquids and reflect increased levels of activity in our development programs and major projects. Our 2014 capital budget of $16.7 billion will target our diverse portfolio of global opportunities, with approximately 55 percent of the budget allocated toward North America and 45 percent toward Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. Our investments will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia, as well as exploration opportunities which will continue to build our inventory for the future. Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2013 included the following: Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 179 percent from reserve additions of approximately 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Achieved annual production of 1,545 MBOED, including continuing operations of 1,502 MBOED and discontinued operations of 43 MBOED, and generated earnings of $8.0 billion. Increased quarterly dividend by 4.5 percent. Generated $10.2 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions. Announced two deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries at Coronado and Gila, adding to the existing Shenandoah and Tiber discoveries in 2009. Eagle Ford and Bakken production increased 60 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Commenced production from major projects at Christina Lake Phase E, Ekofisk South and Jasmine, with preparations underway for full-field startup at Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai in 2014. Business Environment The business environment for the energy industry has historically experienced many challenges which have influenced our operations and profitability, largely due to factors beyond our control, such as the global financial crisis and recession which began in 2008; supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts; environmental laws; tax regulations; governmental policies; and weather-related disruptions. Recently, North America energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of 36 Table of Contents supply, as a result of advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of shale production, successful exploration and development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. These dynamics generally influence world energy markets and commodity prices. The most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of our operating cash flows into our business is commodity prices, which can be very volatile; therefore, our strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a diverse portfolio of assets, which we believe will provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles. Operating and Financial Priorities Important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2013 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industry ability to respond to subsea well-control incidents in international waters. Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in adding to our proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2013, our organic reserve replacement was 145 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Disciplined investment approach. We participate in a capital-intensive industry. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on organic growth in volumes and margins through higher-margin oil, condensate and LNG projects and limited investment in North American 37 Table of Contents conventional natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we expect a corresponding shift in our production mix. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment decision to the time the asset is operational and generates financial returns. Our actual capital program for 2013 was $16.9 billion, excluding a $2.8 billion prepayment to FCCL for the remaining balance of our joint venture acquisition obligation. Our capital budget for 2014 is $16.7 billion. Approximately 13 percent of the 2014 capital budget is allocated toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio, including planned turnarounds; 39 percent is allocated to high-margin development drilling programs, mostly in North America, which is intended to offset natural field decline from our producing assets; 35 percent is focused on sanctioned major developments, such as Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) and Surmont Phase 2; and 13 percent is planned for our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target both conventional and unconventional plays. Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic holdings. In 2012, we announced plans to sell $8 $10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. During 2013, we received proceeds from dispositions of approximately $10.2 billion, which primarily resulted from: o The disposition of our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan, located in Kazakhstan. o The sale of our Algeria business. o The sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in North Dakota and Montana. o The sale of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, located in Canada. o The disposition of our 39 percent equity investment in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago. o The disposition of a portion of our working interests in the Poseidon discovery in the Browse Basin and the Goldwyer Shale in the Canning Basin. o The disposition of certain properties located in southwest Louisiana. o The sale of our 10 percent interest in the Interconnector Pipeline, located in Europe. As previously announced, we entered into agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. The upstream sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2014 and generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments. We have received deposits to date of $500 million, with the remainder of approximately $1.0 billion due at closing. The buyer has until March 31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of Brass LNG would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments. During 2012, we received proceeds of $2.1 billion from the sale of our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and the additional dilution of our interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Although we are near completion of the 2012 2013 asset disposition program, we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction. We will prune the portfolio as necessary and direct our capital investments to areas which will achieve our strategic objectives. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. As managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industry, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 4 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily as a result of higher operating expenses in the Lower 48 associated with increased production. 38 Table of Contents Applying technical capability . We focus on ways to leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices where they matter most. In 2013, we tested new technology as a means to provide remote monitoring capability, as well as new methods that could increase production and reduce water usage and emissions from assets, such as the oil sands and unconventional reservoirs. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. As part of our future workforce planning, we are committed to increasing student interest in energy industry professions by awarding scholarships in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, accounting and finance, as well as providing university internships to attract the best talent. We also recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. Career development is an important investment in our employees and our future, so we focus on continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to accelerate technical and functional skills of our employees. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Commodity prices. Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following table depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Dollars Per Unit 2013 2012 2011 Market Indicators WTI (per barrel) $ 97.90 94.16 95.05 Dated Brent (per barrel) 108.65 111.58 111.27 U.S. Henry Hub first of month (per million British thermal units) 3.65 2.79 4.04 Brent crude oil prices decreased 3 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, to average $108.65 per barrel, as disruptions to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) supplies were more than offset by non-OPEC production growth. Global oil demand grew 1 percent, or about 1.2 million barrels per day, to 91.2 million barrels per day. The fiscal uncertainties that plagued many developed countries, while not completely resolved, subsided enough to help restore confidence and growth in real economic activity in 2013. WTI crude oil prices increased 4 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, as new infrastructure helped to alleviate the glut at Cushing, Oklahoma, by increasing the movement of physical barrels toward U.S. Gulf Coast refining centers. As a result, the WTI discount to Brent decreased by 38 percent to average $10.75. U.S. crude oil production grew 16 percent to reach an average of 7.5 million barrels per day. The growth was led by shale oil developments such as Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian. U.S. oil demand increased by 2 percent in 2013, as economic growth strengthened. Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 31 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Strong weather-driven demand growth outweighed production growth and drew down high storage inventories. U.S. natural gas consumption rose 2 percent, or 1.5 billion cubic feet per day, to an all-time high of 39 Table of Contents 71.2 billion cubic feet per day. U.S. dry gas production increased 1 percent, by 0.8 billion cubic feet per day, to reach 66.5 billion cubic feet per day, as growth from the Marcellus shale gas play more than offset declines in other areas. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. As a result, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 11 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Our realized bitumen price remained relatively flat in 2013. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2013 totaled $0.5 billion and mainly resulted from impairments of various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Before-tax impairments in 2012 totaled $1.2 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in Canada; Cedar Creek Anticline in the Lower 48; various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives; and the N Block in the Caspian Sea. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya period of civil unrest. In the United Kingdom, the government enacted tax legislation in both 2012 and 2011, which increased our U.K. corporate tax rate. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. 40 Table of Contents Outlook Due to the ongoing shutdown of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, we intend to exclude Libya from our future production outlooks. Production from continuing operations for 2013 was 1,502 MBOED, or 1,472 MBOED adjusted for Libya. Full-year 2014 production from continuing operations is expected to be approximately 1,550 MBOED, excluding Libya. First-quarter 2014 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,490 to 1,530 MBOED, excluding Libya. Our Corporate and Other segment earnings are expected to be an after-tax loss of approximately $1.0 billion for the full-year 2014. Freeport LNG Terminal We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeport 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. In July 2013, we agreed with Freeport LNG to terminate this agreement, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant. Upon satisfaction of these conditions, currently expected to occur in the second half of 2014, we will pay Freeport LNG a termination fee of approximately $600 million. Freeport LNG will repay the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, will result in a one-time net cash outflow of approximately $80 million for us. When the agreement becomes effective, we also expect to recognize an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $540 million. At that time, our terminal regasification capacity will be reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day, until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in operating costs over the next 19 years. For additional information, see Note 4 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. The LUKOIL Investment segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Alaska $ 2,274 2,276 1,984 Lower 48 and Latin America 1,081 1,029 1,288 Canada 718 (684 ) 91 Europe 1,199 1,498 1,830 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,591 3,996 3,093 Other International (6 ) 359 (377) LUKOIL Investment - - 239 Corporate and Other (820 ) (993 ) (960) Income from continuing operations $ 8,037 7,481 7,188 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 7 percent in 2013. The increase was mainly due to: Lower impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2013 totaled $289 million after-tax, compared with $900 million after-tax in 2012. Higher natural gas prices. A higher proportion of production in higher-margin areas and a continued portfolio shift toward liquids. Lower production taxes, primarily as a result of lower production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. These items were partially offset by: Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and China. Lower gains from asset sales. In 2013, gains from asset dispositions were $1,132 million after-tax, compared with gains of $1,567 million after-tax in 2012. Higher operating expenses. Lower crude oil and natural gas liquids prices. 42 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 4 percent in 2012. The increase was mainly due to: Higher gains from asset sales. In 2012, gains from asset dispositions were $1,567 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2011 from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales of $141 million after-tax. Higher LNG and crude oil prices. Lower production taxes, mainly as a result of lower volumes. The benefit from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million. The favorable resolution of pending claims and settlements of $235 million after-tax. These items were partially offset by: Lower volumes, largely due to dispositions and reduced production in China. Lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen prices. Higher operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included pension settlement expenses of $87 million after-tax and separation costs of $84 million after-tax. Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2012 totaled $900 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2011 of $698 million after-tax. 43 Table of Contents Income Statement Analysis 2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower natural gas volumes and lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 16 percent in 2013. The increase primarily resulted from higher earnings from FCCL Partnership, mainly as a result of higher bitumen volumes. Gain on dispositions decreased 25 percent in 2013. For additional information, see Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 20 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2012 benefit which resulted from the favorable resolution of the Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. The decrease was partly offset by a $150 million insurance settlement in 2013 associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. For information on a separate PDVSA arbitration with the World Bank International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), see Note 14 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 10 percent in 2013, largely as a result of lower purchased natural gas volumes, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Production and operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2013, primarily due to increased drilling activity and production volumes, mostly in the Lower 48, in addition to a charge related to a settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East. These increases were partly offset by the reduction of an accrual related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). SG&A expenses decreased 23 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of separation costs, lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. For additional information on pension settlement expense, see Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Exploration expenses decreased 18 percent in 2013, largely due to lower leasehold impairment costs. Exploration costs in 2012 included the $481 million impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, as a result of the indefinite suspension of the project. Increased 2013 exploration activity and higher dry hole costs, mostly in the Lower 48, partly offset the reduction. DD&A increased 13 percent in 2013. The increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48. Higher production volumes in China partly contributed to the increase. Impairments decreased 22 percent in 2013. Impairments in 2013 mainly consisted of increases in the asset retirement obligation (ARO) for properties located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Impairments in 2012 consisted of impairments of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline and impairments of late-life U.K. properties. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 19 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. Interest and debt expense decreased 14 percent in 2013, mostly as a result of lower interest expense from lower average debt levels. 44 Table of Contents See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 10 percent in 2012, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partly offset by higher LNG prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 54 percent in 2012. The increase primarily resulted from: Improved earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), mainly due to higher LNG prices, partly offset by lower volumes. Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment. Gain on dispositions increased $1,287 million in 2012. Gains in 2012 primarily resulted from the disposition of our Vietnam business, our equity investment in NMNG and the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, partly offset by the loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Gains in 2011 mainly consisted of the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares and the disposition of certain properties located in the Lower 48 and Canada, partially offset by the loss on the initial dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Other income increased 78 percent in 2012, mostly as a result of the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. Purchased commodities decreased 15 percent in 2012, largely as a result of lower U.S. natural gas prices, partly offset by higher purchased volumes. Production and operating expenses increased 6 percent in 2012, mostly due to major turnaround expenses at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility and higher operating expenses in the Lower 48. SG&A expenses increased 28 percent in 2012, primarily due to pension settlement expense and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66. Exploration expenses increased 45 percent in 2012, mostly due to the Mackenzie Gas Project impairment. Impairments increased 112 percent in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included the impairment of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, and impairments of various late-life properties, mostly located in the United Kingdom. Impairments in 2011 consisted of various North American natural gas properties. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 11 percent in 2012, mostly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes. Interest and debt expense decreased 26 percent in 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest on projects and lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 45 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2013 2012 2011 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD)* 581 595 622 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 156 156 145 Bitumen (MBD) 109 93 67 Natural gas (MMCFD)** 3,939 4,096 4,359 Total Production (MBOED)*** 1,502 1,527 1,561 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 103.32 105.72 105.52 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 41.42 46.36 55.73 Bitumen (per barrel) 53.27 53.91 62.56 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 6.11 5.48 5.80 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 789 626 569 Leasehold impairment 175 719 159 Dry holes 268 155 310 $ 1,232 1,500 1,038 Excludes discontinued operations. *Thousands of barrels per day. **Millions of cubic feet per day.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2013, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia. In 2013, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2012, mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production, due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and the impact from the closure of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012. In 2012, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2011, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48. 46 Table of Contents Alaska 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 2,274 2,276 1,984 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 178 188 200 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 15 16 15 Natural gas (MMCFD) 43 55 61 Total Production (MBOED) 200 213 225 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 107.83 109.62 105.95 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.35 4.22 4.56 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2013, Alaska contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Alaska earnings in 2013 were flat compared with 2012 earnings. Earnings in 2013 were mainly impacted by lower crude oil volumes and lower crude oil prices. These decreases to earnings were mostly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from lower prices, higher 2013 capital spending and lower crude oil production volumes. Additionally, 2013 earnings benefitted from the impact of a ruling by the FERC. In 2012, the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013, the FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. Under the terms of the agreements, we paid the other remaining owners of TAPS $355 million, including interest, in the third quarter of 2013. As a result of FERC approval of these agreements, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax. The FERC ruling approving these agreements has been appealed by certain parties to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Production averaged 200 MBOED in 2013, a decrease of 6 percent compared with 2012. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower planned downtime. 2012 vs. 2011 Alaska earnings in 2012 increased 15 percent compared with earnings in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices, lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes, the absence of the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011, and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating expenses. Production averaged 213 MBOED in 2012, a decrease of 5 percent compared with 2011. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower unplanned downtime. 47 Table of Contents Lower 48 and Latin America 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 1,081 1,029 1,288 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 152 123 94 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 91 85 74 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,490 1,493 1,556 Total Production (MBOED) 491 457 428 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 93.79 91.67 92.79 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 31.48 35.45 50.55 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 3.50 2.67 3.99 During 2013, Lower 48 and Latin America contributed 29 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production. The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states, as well as exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia. 2013 vs. 2012 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings increased 5 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Earnings in 2013 largely benefitted from higher crude oil and NGL volumes, higher gains from asset dispositions, mostly as a result of the $288 million after-tax gain on disposition of our equity investment in Phoenix Park, higher natural gas and crude oil prices and lower impairments. These increases were partially offset by higher DD&A, as a result of higher crude oil production, as well as the absence of the 2012 realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million and the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration, as more fully described below. Higher operating expenses, higher exploration expenses, which mainly resulted from the Thorn and Ardennes dry holes in the Gulf of Mexico, and lower NGL prices also partially offset the increase in 2013 earnings. For additional information on asset sales, see Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which was reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. For information on a separate PDVSA ICSID arbitration, see Note 14 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2013, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent in the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline and the impact from dispositions. 2012 vs. 2011 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings decreased 20 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of substantially lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production; lower gains from asset dispositions; higher operating expenses and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil 48 Table of Contents and natural gas liquids volumes. Earnings in 2012 also benefitted from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million, and the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. Average production increased 7 percent in 2012, while average crude oil production increased 31 percent over the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline. In addition, higher unplanned downtime during 2012 partly offset the increase in production.

In 2013, Canada contributed 17 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 20 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Canada operations reported earnings of $718 million in 2013, an increase of $1,402 million, compared with a loss of $684 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 earnings was largely due to: The $461 million after-tax gain on disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold. Lower impairments. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada. Impairments in 2012 mainly resulted from the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated undeveloped leaseholds. Higher bitumen volumes, primarily at Christina Lake. The recognition of additional income of $224 million related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties in a prior year. 49 Table of Contents For additional information on asset sales, see Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on impairments, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production in Canada increased 1 percent in 2013, while average liquids production increased 13 percent in the same period, primarily from the oil sands. Normal field decline was more than offset by the ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phases D and E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance from western Canada. 2012 vs. 2011 Canada operations reported a loss of $684 million in 2012, a reduction of $775 million, compared with earnings of $91 million in 2011. The decrease in earnings was largely due to significantly lower natural gas prices, lower bitumen prices and higher impairments, mainly as a result of the Mackenzie Gas Project impairment in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher bitumen volumes from FCCL and lower DD&A from our western Canadian gas assets, primarily due to asset dispositions and curtailments. Equity earnings from FCCL were also impacted by higher operating and DD&A expenses, mostly as a result of higher production volumes. Average production in Canada increased 5 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. Normal field decline and the impact from asset dispositions were more than offset by new production from Christina Lake Phases C and D and improved well performance from Foster Creek in FCCL.

In 2013, our Europe operations contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 11 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Europe operations reported a 20 percent decrease in 2013 earnings compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2012 included the $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields, compared with the $83 million after-tax gain on sale of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of 50 Table of Contents the recognition of $170 million in additional income tax expense in 2012, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. Average production decreased 17 percent in 2013, primarily due to normal field decline. Major planned maintenance at Greater Ekofisk, higher unplanned downtime, mostly in the East Irish Sea, and asset dispositions also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from Jasmine and Ekofisk South. 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings from Europe decreased 18 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly as a result of lower volumes, higher impairments and the U.K. tax increase. These decreases to earnings were partly offset by the gain on disposition of Statfjord and Alba and lower DD&A. Additionally, earnings in 2011 included a $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense due to legislation enacted in 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. Production decreased 18 percent in 2012, mostly due to normal field decline, dispositions and higher unplanned downtime in the United Kingdom. 51 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 3,591 3,996 3,093 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 80 68 99 Equity affiliates 15 15 16 Total crude oil 95 83 115 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 12 16 12 Equity affiliates 7 8 7 Total natural gas liquids 19 24 19 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 709 672 695 Equity affiliates 481 485 492 Total natural gas 1,190 1,157 1,187 Total Production (MBOED) 312 300 332 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 104.78 108.20 109.84 Equity affiliates 105.44 108.07 106.96 Total crude oil 104.88 108.18 109.46 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 73.82 79.26 72.87 Equity affiliates 73.31 77.30 70.62 Total natural gas liquids 73.63 78.64 71.98 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 10.61 10.63 9.82 Equity affiliates 8.98 8.54 5.93 Total natural gas 9.95 9.75 8.21 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has producing operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Bangladesh and Brunei. During 2013, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 30 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 10 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease in earnings was largely due to: Lower gains from asset dispositions. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 included the $937 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business, in addition to the $133 million after-tax loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Higher DD&A, mostly due to increased production in China. A $116 million after-tax charge associated with a settlement. 52 Table of Contents Lower crude oil prices. Higher operating expenses and production taxes. The absence of a $72 million tax-related charge in 2012. These decreases to earnings were partially offset by: Higher crude oil and LNG volumes. A $146 million after-tax insurance settlement associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. The absence of an $89 million after-tax charge related to the Bohai Bay settlement with the China State Oceanic Administration in 2012. Higher equity earnings, mainly due to an $85 million tax benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Average production increased 4 percent in 2013. The improvement was largely due to: Increased production in Bohai Bay, China. New production from Panyu in the South China Sea. The continued ramp-up of production in Malaysia. Lower planned downtime, mainly from our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and the Vietnam disposition. 2012 vs. 2011 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased 29 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from higher gains from asset dispositions, significantly higher LNG prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A and operating expenses from QG3, and lower Bohai Bay expenses incurred in 2012. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 consisted of the Vietnam gain and the APLNG loss on further dilution from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent, compared with a $279 million after-tax loss on the initial dilution of our interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent in 2011. The increase in 2012 earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil volumes, mainly as a result of the Bohai Bay seepage incidents and the Vietnam disposition, lower LNG volumes and higher production taxes. Average production decreased 10 percent in 2012. The decrease was largely due to the disposition of our Vietnam business, normal field decline, planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility in 2012, as well as lower production in China. 53 Table of Contents Other International 2013 2012 2011 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (6 ) 359 (377) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 26 40 8 Equity affiliates 4 13 29 Total crude oil 30 53 37 Natural gas (MMCFD) 25 18 1 Total Production (MBOED) 34 56 37 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 107.21 110.75 98.30 Equity affiliates 72.43 96.50 101.62 Total crude oil 101.91 107.56 101.14 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) 5.38 5.55 0.09 The Other International segment includes producing operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Angola, Senegal and Azerbaijan. During 2013, Other International contributed 4 percent of our worldwide liquids production. 2013 vs. 2012 Other International operations reported a loss of $6 million in 2013, compared with earnings of $359 million in 2012. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to the absence of the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. Lower volumes from Libya also contributed to the reduction. These decreases were partially offset by lower impairments. Earnings in 2012 included a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Average production decreased 39 percent in 2013, largely as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya at the end of July 2013 and the disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by higher production from Libya during the first six months of 2013, compared with the ramp-up of production in 2012 following their period of civil unrest. Libya production remains shut-in, as the Es Sider Terminal closure has continued into the first quarter of 2014. 2012 vs. 2011 Other International earnings were $359 million in 2012, a $736 million increase compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from the NMNG disposition, the absence of a $395 million after-tax impairment of our investment in NMNG in 2011, and higher earnings from Libya, as a result of the resumption of production following a period of civil unrest in 2011. These increases were partially offset by the N Block impairment. Average production increased 51 percent in 2012, mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by field decline in Russia and the disposition of our interest in NMNG. 54 Table of Contents Asset Dispositions In 2013, we sold our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan for $5.4 billion, and we sold our Algeria business for $1.65 billion. We also have agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG.

Net interest decreased 18 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to the absence of a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement in 2012 and lower interest expense on lower average debt levels. These improvements were partially offset by the absence of the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. For additional information on the ICC arbitration, see the Results of Operations for Lower 48 and Latin America. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 32 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax, compared with $87 million after-tax in 2012. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands; unconventional reservoirs; subsurface technology; liquefied natural gas; and arctic, deepwater and sustainability technology. Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. 55 Table of Contents The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Other expenses increased $127 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher tax-related adjustments, the absence of a $39 million after-tax settlement which benefitted 2012 and higher foreign currency transaction losses. 2012 vs. 2011 Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, mostly due to higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels, higher interest income and the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the favorable resolution of the PDVSA arbitration. These improvements were partly offset by a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 65 percent in 2012, mainly due to $87 million of after-tax pension settlement expense and higher costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Technology reported a loss of $4 million in 2012, compared to earnings of $15 million in 2011, primarily as a result of lower licensing revenues. Separation costs increased $59 million in 2012 and mainly included costs related to compensation and benefit plans. The improvement in Other in 2012 was largely due to various tax-related adjustments, including a $39 million after-tax settlement. These improvements were partially offset by higher environmental expenses and foreign currency transaction losses. 56 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 15,801 13,458 13,953 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 286 464 5,693 Cash and cash equivalents 6,246 3,618 5,780 Short-term debt 589 955 1,013 Total debt 21,662 21,725 22,623 Total equity 52,492 48,427 65,749 Percent of total debt to capital* 29 % 31 26 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 8 % 9 10 * Capital includes total debt and total equity. ** Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2013, we received $10,220 million in proceeds from asset sales. We used the remaining $748 million of our restricted cash balance, received in connection with the separation of Phillips 66, solely to pay dividends. During 2013, the primary uses of our available cash were $15,537 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $3,334 million to pay dividends on our common stock; $2,810 million to prepay the remaining balance of our joint venture acquisition obligation with our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership; and $946 million to repay debt. During 2013, cash and cash equivalents increased by $2,628 million, to $6,246 million. In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital expenditures and investments, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2013, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $15,801 million, a 17 percent increase from 2012. The increase was primarily related to lower income taxes due to a greater proportion of volumes in areas with more favorable fiscal regimes. During 2012, cash provided by continuing operations was $13,458 million, compared with $13,953 million in 2011. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and their 57 Table of Contents timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our 2013 production from continuing operations averaged 1,502 MBOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production from continuing operations in 2014 is expected to be 1,550 MBOED, excluding Libya. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2013 was 147 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 179 percent of 2013 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2013, our reserve replacement was 69 percent (including 95 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 145 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2013 were $10,220 million, primarily from the sale of our 8.4 percent equity interest in Kashagan, the sale of our Algeria business, the sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, the sale of our interest in the Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, the sale of our 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park and the sale of a portion of our working interests in Browse and Canning basins. This compares with proceeds of $2,132 million in 2012, primarily from the sale of our Vietnam business, the sale of our equity interest in NMNG and the sale of our interest in the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea. As previously announced, we entered into agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. The upstream sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2014 and generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments. We have received deposits to date of $500 million, with the remainder of approximately $1.0 billion due at closing. The buyer has until March 31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of Brass LNG would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2013, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. 58 Table of Contents Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $961 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013, compared with $1,055 million at December 31, 2012. Since we had $961 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2013. Our senior long-term debt is rated A1 by Moody Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poor Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had direct bank letters of credit of $827 million and $852 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 13 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section. Our debt balance at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, was $21.7 billion. During 2013, we repaid bonds at maturity totaling $850 million. In June 2013, we incurred a capital lease obligation of $906 million. For more information, see Note 11 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007. The principal portion of these payments totaled $772 million in 2013. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. 59 Table of Contents This $2,810 million prepayment substantially increases the FCCL Partnership ability to make distributions to its partners or fund future capital requirements without contributions from the partners. Interest accrued at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. In July 2013, we announced a 4.5 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to 69 cents per share. Additionally, on February 5, 2014, we announced a dividend of 69 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March 3, 2014, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2014. In February 2014, the $400 million 4.75% Notes due 2014 were repaid at maturity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2013: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1 Year Years 2-3 Years 4-5 After 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 20,740 514 3,678 1,838 14,710 Capital lease obligations (b) 922 75 100 108 639 Total debt 21,662 589 3,778 1,946 15,349 Interest on debt and other obligations 15,259 1,137 2,076 1,900 10,146 Operating lease obligations (c) 2,749 602 1,002 500 645 Purchase obligations (d) 23,338 10,008 3,548 2,368 7,414 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 2,117 560 737 820 - Asset retirement obligations (f) 10,076 489 1,333 805 7,449 Accrued environmental costs (g) 348 50 61 40 197 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 144 144 (h ) (h ) (h) Total $ 75,693 13,579 12,535 8,379 41,200 (a) Includes $404 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 11 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis. (c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $9,610 million. Purchase obligations of $10,538 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. 60 Table of Contents (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2014 through 2018. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2018, see Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $511 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, totaled $40.9 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and developments, primarily: Oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in the Lower 48, including the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays, and the Permian Basin. Development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Jasmine and Clair Ridge areas, and appraisal activities in the Greater Clair Area. Oil sands development and ongoing liquids-focused plays in Canada. Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, and the Western North Slope. Exploration leases and wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Continued development of offshore fields in Malaysia and ongoing exploration and development activity onshore and offshore Indonesia and Australia. 61 Table of Contents 2014 CAPITAL BUDGET Our 2014 capital budget is $16.7 billion, essentially flat compared with our 2013 capital program. We are directing approximately 55 percent of our 2014 capital expenditures budget for continuing operations to North America. These funds are expected to be directed toward: Increased investment in the Company successful development drilling programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. Higher allocation of capital to Alaska compared to 2013, reflecting increased spending on the CD5 development and higher activity resulting from improved fiscal terms from the passage of the More Alaska Production Act. Increased exploration and appraisal activity in several North American unconventional plays, including the Permian, Niobrara, Canol and Duvernay. Higher levels of spending at Surmont Phase 2, in anticipation of first production in 2015. Increased conventional exploration drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We are directing approximately 45 percent of our 2014 capital expenditures budget for continuing operations to Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. These funds are expected to be directed toward: Peak spending at the APLNG Project, in anticipation of first LNG sales. Conventional exploration drilling offshore Angola, Senegal and the Browse Basin. Investments in Eldfisk II, Britannia Long-term Compression and Clair Ridge. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 14 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 62 Table of Contents Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise 63 Table of Contents to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2012, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 11 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2013, we had been notified of 4 new sites, bringing the number of unresolved sites with potential liability to 15 sites. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $546 million in 2013 and are expected to be about $580 million per year in 2014 and 2015. Capitalized environmental costs were $357 million in 2013 and are expected to be about $480 million per year in 2014 and 2015. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, 64 Table of Contents operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2013, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $348 million, compared with $364 million at December 31, 2012, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2013 was approximately $2 million (net share pre-tax). A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July 1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2013 was approximately $6 million. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. The EPA announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA and U.S. Department of Transportation joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2013 was approximately $44 million (net share pre-tax). Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation, which took effect in July 2012. Our cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation in 2013 was approximately $10 million (net share pre-tax). 65 Table of Contents In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). The GHG reductions required. The price and availability of offsets. The amount and allocation of allowances. Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. Reducing GHG emissions In 2012 the Company reduced GHG emissions by approximately 1,000,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. Engaging externally The Company is a sponsor of MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $6 to $46 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 66 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2013, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,830 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $558 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 56 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2014 would increase by approximately $39 million. At year-end 2013, the remaining $6,708 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2014. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 67 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2013, total suspended well costs were $994 million, compared with $1,038 million at year-end 2012. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income 68 Table of Contents statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2013, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $59 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2013 was approximately $7.0 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2012 and 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2013. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2013 would have increased by an estimated $370 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance 69 Table of Contents considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $120 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. See Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 70 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
