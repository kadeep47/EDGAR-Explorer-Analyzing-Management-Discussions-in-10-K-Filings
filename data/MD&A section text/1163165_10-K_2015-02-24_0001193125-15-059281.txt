For additional information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. At December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 19,100 people worldwide and had total assets of $117 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Basis of Presentation Effective April 1, 2014, the Other International segment was restructured to focus on enhancing our capability to operate in emerging and new country business units. As a result, we moved the Latin America and Poland businesses from the historically presented Lower 48 and Latin America segment and the Europe segment to the Other International segment. Results of operations for the Lower 48, Europe and Other International segments have been revised for all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial results, and the impact on our segment presentation was immaterial. For additional information, see Note 23 Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview We are an independent E&P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our asset base reflects our legacy as a major company with a strategic focus on higher-margin developments. Our diverse portfolio primarily includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Since the separation of the downstream business in 2012, our value proposition to our shareholders has been to deliver 3 to 5 percent production and 3 to 5 percent cash margin growth, normalized for changes in commodity prices, pay a competitive dividend, improve financial returns, and maintain our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. This value proposition was predicated on capital expenditures of approximately $16 billion annually. 32 Table of Contents We achieved our value proposition in 2014 and met our strategic objectives; however, in response to a significant downturn in commodity prices beginning in the second half of 2014, we have elected to reduce our 2015 capital program to $11.5 billion. At this level of capital, we expect to achieve 2 to 3 percent production growth in 2015. The dividend remains our top priority, and we anticipate cash flow neutrality (cash from continuing operations sufficient to fund our dividend and capital program) in 2017. We continue to monitor the environment and will exercise additional capital reductions or balance sheet flexibility, as appropriate, to withstand this cycle. Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2014 included the following: Achieved 4 percent full-year production growth from continuing operations, excluding Libya. Realized 8 percent price-normalized cash margin per BOE growth. Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 124 percent from reserve additions of approximately 0.7 billion BOE. Completed the asset disposition program with sale of Nigerian business for $1.4 billion. Achieved a combined 35 percent year-over-year production increase in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. Commenced production from five major projects at Siakap North-Petai, Foster Creek Phase F, Britannia Long-Term Compression, Gumusut and Kebabangan, as well as first production from Eldfisk II in January 2015. Discovered oil in two new plays offshore Senegal. Ended the year with $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We accomplished several strategic milestones in 2014. Through major project startups, development drilling and increased investment in higher-margin areas, we achieved 4 percent production growth from continuing operations, excluding Libya. Our net income attributable to ConocoPhillips per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) decreased 27 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. This reduction mainly resulted from lower gains from dispositions and higher impairments. Our cash margin per BOE, normalized based on 2013 prices, increased 8 percent over the same period, which reflects an underlying portfolio shift to liquids and more favorable fiscal regimes. For additional information on the calculations for Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips per BOE and Price Normalized Cash Margin per BOE, see Non-GAAP Reconciliation: Price Normalized Cash Margin per BOE, beginning on page 63. In 2014 we achieved production of 1,561 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), including production from discontinued operations of 21 MBOED. Excluding Libya, our production from continuing operations was 1,532 MBOED, compared with 1,472 MBOED in 2013. The startup of several major projects in 2014 and continued success in shale plays enabled us to achieve our volume growth target. With the startup of Eldfisk II in early 2015, anticipated startups at Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) and Surmont 2 in 2015, and ongoing development program activity, we believe we can achieve production growth of 2 to 3 percent in 2015. Consistent with our commitment to offer our shareholders a competitive dividend, in July 2014 our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 5.8 percent to $0.73 per share. During 2014 we generated $16.6 billion in cash from continuing operations, which included a one-time $1.3 billion distribution from our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership, and we generated $1.6 billion in proceeds from dispositions of non-core assets. We also paid dividends on our common stock of $3.5 billion and ended the year with $5.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We funded a $17.1 billion capital program in 2014, which yielded a strong, annual organic reserve replacement ratio of 124 percent. The organic reserve additions represent a continuing portfolio shift to higher-value liquids and reflect increased levels of activity in our development programs and major projects. 33 Table of Contents In December 2014 we announced a capital budget of $13.5 billion for 2015, a reduction of 21 percent compared with actual capital spending of $17.1 billion in 2014. In January 2015 we further reduced the capital budget by $2.0 billion, due to the ongoing decline in commodity prices. The $5.6 billion reduction primarily reflects the deferral of spending on certain North American unconventional plays, lower spending on major projects, several of which are nearing completion, and the deferral of some exploration programs. Capital spending on several major projects has peaked, such as APLNG, Surmont 2 and Eldfisk II, and we will realize the benefit of production growth from these projects over the next few years. This lower level of investment associated with major projects allows us to have increasing flexibility with our capital program. Our 2015 capital budget of $11.5 billion will target our diverse portfolio of global opportunities and will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia; the completion of major projects, such as APLNG and Surmont 2; as well as exploration opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa which will continue to build our inventory for the future. Business Environment In the first half of 2014, the energy industry experienced strong prices for crude oil, driven by geopolitical tensions impacting supplies, as well as global oil demand growth. This was followed by an abrupt decline in prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 to near five-year lows, as surging production growth from U.S. shale and the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain current production outweighed fears of supply disruptions. This, combined with lower forecasts for global oil demand growth, caused crude oil prices to plummet to the $60-per-barrel-range at the end of 2014. More recently, prices for WTI and Brent have continued to decrease to the mid-$40-per-barrel-range, less than half of June 2014 prices. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions, which have impacted our operations and profitability and are largely due to factors beyond our control. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Other dynamics which have influenced world energy markets and commodity prices included the global financial crisis and recession which began in 2008, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. Additionally, North America energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply, as a result of advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of shale production, successful exploration and development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. In order to navigate through a volatile market, our strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a diverse and flexible portfolio of assets which will provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles. Operating and Financial Priorities Other important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2014 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industry ability to respond to subsea well-control incidents in international waters. 34 Table of Contents Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in adding to our proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2014, our organic reserve replacement was 143 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Disciplined investment approach. We participate in a capital-intensive industry, which often experiences long lead times from the time an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on organic growth in volumes and margins through higher-margin oil, condensate and LNG projects and limited investment in North American natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we have experienced a corresponding shift in our production mix. In 2014 our average liquids production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased 7 percent compared with 2013. In 2013 our average liquids production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased 2 percent compared with 2012. Our 2015 capital budget is $11.5 billion, a reduction of 33 percent compared with our actual 2014 capital spend of $17.1 billion. The decrease mainly reflects a slower pace of development on North American unconventional plays, the elimination of peak spending on major capital projects due to their anticipated startup in 2015, and the deferral of certain exploration programs. Our capital budget will be allocated toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio; higher-margin development drilling programs, primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken; sanctioned major developments, specifically the completion of APLNG and Surmont 2; and our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target conventional activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and Nova Scotia, as well as unconventional activity in North America. In response to weakening commodity prices, we plan to slow the pace of certain investments, such as in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, as well as emerging unconventional plays in the Permian, Niobrara, Montney and Duvernay. We retain the flexibility to increase or decrease investment activity and may reassess our near-term investment decisions as necessary. Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic assets. In 2012 we announced plans to sell $8 $10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. We completed this disposition program with the July 2014 sale of our Nigeria upstream affiliates. As part of this program, we generated $14.0 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions through December 31, 2014. 35 Table of Contents Although we have completed the asset disposition program, we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction. We will optimize the portfolio as necessary and direct our capital investments to areas we expect will achieve our strategic objectives. Controlling costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry. Applying technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. In 2014 we tested new technology as a means to provide remote monitoring capability, as well as new methods that could increase production and reduce water usage and emissions from assets, such as the oil sands and unconventional reservoirs. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. As part of our future workforce planning, we are committed to increasing student interest in energy industry professions by awarding scholarships in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, accounting and finance, as well as providing university internships to attract the best talent. We also recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We offer continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to accelerate technical and functional skills of our employees. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Commodity prices. Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: 36 Table of Contents Brent crude oil prices averaged $76.27 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 30 percent compared with $109.27 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2013. December 2014 prices for Brent crude oil averaged $62.53 per barrel, a decline of 44 percent compared with June 2014 average prices of $111.65 per barrel. Industry crude prices for WTI averaged $73.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 25 percent compared with $97.38 in the same quarter of 2013. WTI prices in December 2014 averaged $59.50 per barrel, a 43 percent decrease compared with June 2014 average prices of $105.24 per barrel. Crude oil prices have continued to rapidly decline in the first quarter of 2015 to their lowest levels in the past six years to the mid-$40-per-barrel-range, driven downward by rising production, particularly from U.S. shale oil and reduced disruptions from Middle East production, OPEC decision to maintain current production and weaker-than-expected demand in Europe and Asia. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $4.04 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 12 percent compared with the same period in 2013. Average Henry Hub prices were relatively strong in 2014, as prices averaged $4.43 per MCF in 2014 compared with $3.65 in 2013. This was the result of a cold start to 2014; however, natural gas prices softened later in the year due to very strong production growth, particularly from the northeast United States, and a mild start to the 2014/2015 heating season. Domestic natural gas liquids prices experienced a similar decline to crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014, as our domestic realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $24.93 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 27 percent compared with $34.33 per barrel in the same quarter of 2013. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. Declining global crude oil prices have resulted in the Western Canada Select benchmark price experiencing a 50 percent decline from June 2014 to December 2014, from $86.55 per barrel to $43.24 per barrel. Consequently, our realized bitumen price experienced a significant decrease in the second half of 2014. Our total average realized price from continuing operations was $64.59 per BOE in 2014, a decrease of 4 percent compared with $67.62 per BOE in 2013, which reflected lower average realized prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, partly offset by higher bitumen and natural gas prices. Our total average realized prices for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $52.88 per BOE, a reduction of 19 percent compared with $65.41 per BOE in the same period of 2013. The reduction in the fourth quarter of 2014 mainly reflected lower average realized prices across all commodities. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our Company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. 37 Table of Contents Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. For additional information on our impairments in 2014, 2013 and 2012, see Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended or significantly curtailed since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya period of civil unrest. In the United Kingdom, the government enacted tax legislation in both 2012 and 2011, which increased our U.K. corporate tax rate. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. Outlook The company expects to deliver 2 to 3 percent production growth in 2015 from continuing operations, excluding Libya. First-quarter 2015 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,570 MBOED to 1,610 MBOED, excluding Libya. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation of Phillips 66 and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 38 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the Company income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Alaska $ 2,041 2,274 2,276 Lower 48 (22 ) 754 745 Canada 940 718 (684 ) Europe 804 1,229 1,517 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,008 3,591 3,996 Other International (90 ) 291 624 Corporate and Other (874 ) (820 ) (993 ) Income from continuing operations $ 5,807 8,037 7,481 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 28 percent in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to: Lower crude oil prices. Lower gains from asset sales. Gains realized in 2014 were approximately $70 million after-tax, compared with gains realized in 2013 of $1,132 million after-tax. Higher operating expenses, which included the 2014 recognition of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement. Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2014 totaled $662 million after-tax, compared with $289 million after-tax in 2013. Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and the United Kingdom, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada related to reserve bookings. Higher exploration expenses. These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher volumes; lower production taxes, which mainly resulted from higher capital spending, lower prices and lower production volumes in Alaska; and higher natural gas and LNG prices. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 7 percent in 2013. The increase was mainly due to: Lower impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2013 totaled $289 million after-tax, compared with $900 million after-tax in 2012. Higher natural gas prices. A higher proportion of production in higher-margin areas and a continued portfolio shift toward liquids. Lower production taxes, primarily as a result of lower production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. 39 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by: Higher DD&A expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and China. Lower gains from asset sales. In 2013, gains from asset dispositions were $1,132 million after-tax, compared with gains of $1,567 million after-tax in 2012. Higher operating expenses. Lower crude oil and natural gas liquids prices. Income Statement Analysis 2014 vs. 2013 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 3 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher crude oil and bitumen volumes and higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 14 percent in 2014, primarily as a result of higher earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher bitumen volumes and prices. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from APLNG, mostly as a result of higher operating expenses and DD&A. Gain on dispositions decreased $1,144 million in 2014. Gains realized in 2014 mostly resulted from the disposition of certain properties in western Canada. For additional information on gains realized in prior years, see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Production and operating expenses increased 23 percent in 2014, largely due to the $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement. Higher drilling and maintenance activity, mostly in the Lower 48, Australia, Alaska and Europe, in addition to the absence of the 2013 benefit of a $142 million accrual reduction related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), also contributed to the increase. These increases were partly offset by the absence of a $155 million charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay. For additional information on the Freeport LNG transaction, see Note 3 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 14 percent in 2014, mainly due to the absence of pension settlement expenses. Exploration expenses increased 66 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of higher impairments of undeveloped leasehold costs, primarily in the Lower 48 and Canada, and higher dry hole costs, mostly associated with the Gulf of Mexico and Angola. For additional information on the leasehold impairments, see Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DD&A increased 12 percent in 2014. This increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the United Kingdom and the Lower 48, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada associated with year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions and lower natural gas production volumes. Impairments increased 62 percent in 2014. For additional information, see Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 28 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower production taxes, which resulted from higher capital spending, lower crude oil prices and lower production volumes in Alaska. Interest and debt expense increased 6 percent in 2014, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects, partly offset by lower interest expense from lower average debt levels and a $28 million benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. 40 Table of Contents See Note 18 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower natural gas volumes and lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 16 percent in 2013. The increase primarily resulted from higher earnings from FCCL Partnership, mainly as a result of higher bitumen volumes. Gain on dispositions decreased 25 percent in 2013. For additional information, see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 20 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2012 benefit which resulted from the favorable resolution of the Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. The decrease was partly offset by a $150 million insurance settlement in 2013 associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. For information on a separate PDVSA arbitration with the World Bank International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 10 percent in 2013, largely as a result of lower purchased natural gas volumes, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Production and operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2013, primarily due to increased drilling activity and production volumes, mostly in the Lower 48, in addition to a charge related to a settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East. These increases were partly offset by the $142 million accrual reduction associated with FERC approval of pooling agreements with the TAPS owners. SG&A expenses decreased 23 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of separation costs, lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. For additional information on pension settlement expense, see Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Exploration expenses decreased 18 percent in 2013, largely due to lower leasehold impairment costs. Exploration costs in 2012 included the $481 million impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, as a result of the indefinite suspension of the project. Increased 2013 exploration activity and higher dry hole costs, mostly in the Lower 48, partly offset the reduction. DD&A increased 13 percent in 2013. The increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48. Higher production volumes in China partly contributed to the increase. Impairments decreased 22 percent in 2013 and mainly consisted of increases in the asset retirement obligation for properties located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 19 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. Interest and debt expense decreased 14 percent in 2013, mostly as a result of lower interest expense from lower average debt levels.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2014, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia. Total production from continuing operations, including Libya, increased 3 percent in 2014, while average liquids production increased 4 percent. The increase in total average production in 2014 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and the ramp up of production from Jasmine in the United Kingdom and Christina Lake in Canada, and increased drilling programs, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline, higher planned downtime, shut-in Libya production due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and unfavorable market impacts. Adjusted for Libya, production from continuing operations increased by 60 MBOED, or 4 percent, compared with 2013. In 2013 average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2012, mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012. 42 Table of Contents Alaska 2014 2013 2012 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 2,041 2,274 2,276 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 162 178 188 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 13 15 16 Natural gas (MMCFD) 49 43 55 Total Production (MBOED) 183 200 213 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 97.68 107.83 109.62 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 5.42 4.35 4.22 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2014 Alaska contributed 20 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 Alaska earnings decreased 10 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 earnings. The decrease was largely due to lower crude oil prices and volumes; the absence of a $97 million after-tax benefit associated with a FERC ruling in 2013, more fully described below; higher operating expenses; and a $36 million after-tax impairment related to a cancelled project. These reductions to earnings were partly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from higher 2014 capital spending and lower crude oil prices and volumes. Higher LNG sales volumes and prices also partially offset the decrease in 2014 earnings. In 2012 the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013 FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. As a result, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax. Average production decreased 9 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly as a result of normal field decline and higher planned maintenance, partly offset by lower unplanned downtime. 2013 vs. 2012 Alaska earnings in 2013 were flat compared with 2012 earnings. Earnings in 2013 were mainly impacted by lower crude oil volumes and lower crude oil prices. These decreases to earnings were mostly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from lower prices, higher 2013 capital spending and lower crude oil production volumes. Additionally, 2013 earnings benefitted from the FERC ruling discussed above. Average production decreased 6 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower planned downtime. 43 Table of Contents Lower 48 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (22 ) 754 745 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 188 152 123 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 97 91 85 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,491 1,490 1,493 Total Production (MBOED) 533 491 457 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 84.18 93.79 91.67 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 30.74 31.48 35.45 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.29 3.50 2.67 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2014 the Lower 48 contributed 32 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 The Lower 48 reported a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014, compared with earnings of $754 million after-tax in 2013. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to: Higher operating expenses, which included the $545 million after-tax charge to earnings due to the Freeport LNG termination agreement. Lower crude oil prices. Higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil production. Higher impairments. Earnings in 2014 were impacted by impairments of approximately $290 million after-tax. Property impairments were not material in 2013. For additional information, see Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Higher dry hole costs. Dry hole costs in 2014 were approximately $180 million after-tax, primarily for the nonoperated Coronado wildcat and appraisal wells, the Shenandoah appraisal well and the Deep Nansen wildcat well, all located in the Gulf of Mexico. Dry hole costs in 2013 were approximately $130 million after-tax and mainly consisted of the Ardennes and Thorn wells, also located in the Gulf of Mexico. An $83 million after-tax loss recognized upon the release of underutilized transportation and storage capacity at rates below our contractual rates. These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes, higher natural gas prices and a benefit to earnings of approximately $150 million after-tax from marketing third-party natural gas volumes. Rising U.S. production and an increase in pipeline capacity to the Gulf Coast have put downward pressure on Gulf Coast crude oil prices. Prices for Permian Basin crude oil production have been impacted by production increases exceeding pipeline offtake additions. Our average realized prices in the Lower 48 have historically correlated with WTI prices; however, beginning in the second half of 2013, our Lower 48 crude differential versus WTI began to widen. In 2014 our average realized crude oil price of $84.18 per barrel was 10 percent below the WTI price of $93.17 per barrel. 44 Table of Contents Total average production in the Lower 48 increased 9 percent in 2014, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent. The increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and improved drilling and well performance, partially offset by normal field decline. 2013 vs. 2012 Lower 48 earnings increased 1 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Earnings in 2013 largely benefitted from higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes, higher natural gas and crude oil prices and lower impairments. These increases were partially offset by higher DD&A, as a result of higher crude oil production, higher operating expenses, higher exploration expenses, which mainly resulted from the Thorn and Ardennes dry holes, and lower natural gas liquids prices. Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2013, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent in the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline and the impact from dispositions. Canada 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 940 718 (684) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 13 13 13 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 23 25 24 Bitumen (MBD) Consolidated operations 12 13 12 Equity affiliates 117 96 81 Total bitumen 129 109 93 Natural gas (MMCFD) 711 775 857 Total Production (MBOED) 284 276 273 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 77.87 79.73 78.26 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 46.23 47.19 48.64 Bitumen (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 60.03 55.25 57.58 Equity affiliates 54.62 53.00 53.39 Total bitumen 55.13 53.27 53.91 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.13 2.92 2.13 Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2014 Canada contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 Canada earnings increased 31 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of higher natural gas and bitumen prices, lower DD&A from western Canada and higher bitumen volumes. The lower DD&A mainly resulted from lower unit-of-production rates related to year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions 45 Table of Contents and lower natural gas production volumes. Earnings in 2014 also included a $47 million tax benefit resulting from a favorable tax settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, mainly as a result of the $461 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold in 2013, as well as the 2013 recognition of a $224 million tax benefit, related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties in a prior year. Lower natural gas volumes also partially offset the increase in 2014 earnings. In addition, earnings in 2014 benefitted from lower impairments. Impairments in 2014 were $138 million after-tax and consisted primarily of the $109 million after-tax impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada. For additional information on prior year asset sales, see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, and for additional information on impairments, see Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total average production increased 3 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, while bitumen production increased 18 percent over the same period. The continued ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phase E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance were partly offset by normal field decline and higher royalty impacts. 2013 vs. 2012 Canada operations reported earnings of $718 million in 2013, an increase of $1,402 million, compared with a loss of $684 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 earnings was largely due to the Clyden gain on disposition and lower impairments. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada, and impairments in 2012 mainly resulted from the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated undeveloped leaseholds. Higher bitumen volumes, primarily at Christina Lake, and the $224 million favorable tax resolution also benefitted 2013 earnings. Average production in Canada increased 1 percent in 2013, while bitumen production increased 17 percent over the same period. Normal field decline was more than offset by the ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phases D and E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance from western Canada. 46 Table of Contents Europe 2014 2013 2012 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 804 1,229 1,517 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 126 113 135 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 8 6 7 Natural gas (MMCFD) 461 416 516 Total Production (MBOED) 211 189 228 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 99.56 110.56 113.08 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 52.65 58.36 61.53 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 9.29 10.68 9.76 The Europe segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, as well as exploration activities in Greenland. In 2014 our Europe operations contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for Europe decreased 35 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was primarily due to higher DD&A, which mainly resulted from increased production volumes from Jasmine, lower crude oil and natural gas prices, higher taxes and higher impairments. Impairments in 2014 were $192 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2013 of $118 million after-tax. Lower gains from asset dispositions, mostly due to the absence of the $83 million after-tax gain on the disposition of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013, also contributed to the decrease in 2014 earnings. These decreases were partly offset by higher volumes and a $48 million after-tax benefit from a pension-related settlement. For additional information on the impairments, see Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production increased 12 percent in 2014, mostly due to the continued ramp-up of production from Jasmine, the Rivers Acid Plant in the East Irish Sea and Ekofisk South, improved drilling and well performance in Norway and lower planned downtime. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime. 2013 vs. 2012 Europe earnings decreased 19 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2012 included the $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields, compared with the $83 million after-tax Interconnector Pipeline gain in 2013. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of the recognition of $192 million in additional income tax expense in 2012, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. Average production decreased 17 percent in 2013, primarily due to normal field decline. Additionally, major planned maintenance at Greater Ekofisk, higher unplanned downtime, mostly in the East Irish Sea, and asset dispositions contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from Jasmine and Ekofisk South. 47 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2014 2013 2012 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 3,008 3,591 3,996 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 79 80 68 Equity affiliates 15 15 15 Total crude oil 94 95 83 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 10 12 16 Equity affiliates 8 7 8 Total natural gas liquids 18 19 24 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 723 709 672 Equity affiliates 505 481 485 Total natural gas 1,228 1,190 1,157 Total Production (MBOED) 317 312 300 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 95.32 104.78 108.20 Equity affiliates 99.01 105.44 108.07 Total crude oil 95.92 104.88 108.18 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 69.36 73.82 79.26 Equity affiliates 67.20 73.31 77.30 Total natural gas liquids 68.46 73.63 78.64 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 9.80 10.61 10.63 Equity affiliates 9.79 8.98 8.54 Total natural gas 9.80 9.95 9.75 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Bangladesh, Brunei and Myanmar. During 2014 Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 31 percent of our natural gas production. 48 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 16 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was largely due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices; higher operating expenses, mostly as a result of major planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility in Australia; lower equity earnings, mainly due to increased activity at APLNG in preparation for startup in mid-2015; and lower sales volumes, primarily crude oil and LNG. These decreases were partially offset by higher LNG prices, higher natural gas volumes and lower taxes. The 2014 benefits from the absence of the $116 million after-tax charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay and a $30 million after-tax legal settlement in 2014 were offset by the absence of a $146 million after-tax insurance settlement received in 2013, also associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. Average production increased 2 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. Increased production, mainly from Indonesia, China and Malaysia, was largely offset by normal field decline and major planned maintenance at Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG. 2013 vs. 2012 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 10 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease in earnings was largely due to: Lower gains from asset dispositions. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 included the $937 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business, in addition to the $133 million after-tax loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Higher DD&A, mostly due to increased production in China. A $116 million after-tax charge associated with Bohai Bay. Lower crude oil prices. Higher operating expenses and production taxes. The absence of a $72 million tax-related charge in 2012. These decreases to earnings were partially offset by: Higher crude oil and LNG volumes. A $146 million after-tax insurance settlement associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. The absence of an $89 million after-tax charge related to the Bohai Bay settlement with the China State Oceanic Administration in 2012. Higher equity earnings, mainly due to an $85 million tax benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Average production increased 4 percent in 2013. The improvement was largely due to increased production in Bohai Bay, China, new production from Panyu in the South China Sea, the continued ramp-up of production in Malaysia and lower planned downtime, mainly from our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and the Vietnam disposition. 49 Table of Contents Other International 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (90 ) 291 624 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 8 26 40 Equity affiliates 4 4 13 Total crude oil 12 30 53 Natural gas (MMCFD) 3 25 18 Total Production (MBOED) 12 34 56 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 86.71 107.21 110.75 Equity affiliates 64.14 72.43 96.50 Total crude oil 77.36 101.91 107.56 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) 3.40 5.38 5.55 The Other International segment includes operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Colombia, Poland, Angola, Senegal and Azerbaijan. In 2014 Other International contributed 1 percent of our worldwide liquids production. 2014 vs. 2013 Other International operations reported a loss of $90 million in 2014, compared with earnings of $291 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the lower gains from asset dispositions, mainly from the absence of the $288 million after-tax gain recognized on the 2013 disposition of our equity investment in Phoenix Park Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago; higher dry hole expenses, mostly due to the $136 million after-tax charge for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola; and lower volumes from Libya. These reductions were partially offset by the recognition of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of a contingent liability. Average production decreased 65 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya, which began at the end of July 2013. The Es Sider Terminal briefly reopened in the third quarter of 2014 and production and liftings resumed temporarily; however, further disruptions occurred in December 2014, and production is shut in again. The 2015 drilling program remains uncertain as a result of the ongoing civil unrest. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings from Other International decreased 53 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 earnings. The reduction was mainly due to the absence of the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration, more fully described, below, and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2013 primarily included the $288 million after-tax Phoenix Park disposition, and gains realized in 2012 mostly consisted of the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia. Additionally, lower volumes from Libya contributed to the reduction in earnings. These decreases were partially offset by lower impairments. Earnings in 2012 included a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea. 50 Table of Contents In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which was reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. Average production decreased 39 percent in 2013, largely as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya at the end of July 2013 and the disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by higher production from Libya during the first six months of 2013, compared with the ramp-up of production in 2012 following their period of civil unrest. Venezuela Arbitration In October 2014 we filed for arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA, the Venezuela state oil company, for contractual compensation related to the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects. The ICC arbitration is a separate and independent legal action from the investment treaty arbitration against the government of Venezuela, which is pending before an arbitral tribunal under ICSID. For additional information, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Dispositions In July 2014 we sold our Nigeria upstream affiliates, and we transferred our 17 percent interest in the Brass LNG Project to the remaining shareholders in Brass LNG Limited. In 2013 we sold our Algeria business and our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan). Results of operations related to Nigeria, Algeria and Kashagan have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (502) (530) (648) Corporate general and administrative expenses (194) (213) (313) Technology (93) (6) (4) Separation costs - - (84) Other (85) (71) 56 $ (874) (820) (993) 2014 vs. 2013 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 5 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of a $93 million tax benefit associated with the election of the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States, as well as a $28 million after-tax benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. These improvements were largely offset by lower capitalized interest on projects sold or completed. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense, partly offset by higher benefit-related expenses. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax. We did not incur pension settlement expense in 2014. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands, unconventional reservoirs, LNG, and subsurface, arctic and deepwater technologies, with an underlying commitment to environmental responsibility. Losses from Technology were $93 million in 2014, compared with losses of $6 million in 2013. The reduction in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues and higher research and development expenses. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. 2013 vs. 2012 Net interest decreased 18 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to the absence of a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement in 2012 and lower interest expense on lower average debt levels. These improvements were partially offset by the absence of the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. For additional information on the arbitration, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 32 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax, compared with $87 million after-tax in 2012. Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Other expenses increased $127 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher tax-related adjustments, the absence of a $39 million after-tax settlement which benefitted 2012 and higher foreign currency transaction losses. 52 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 16,592 15,801 13,458 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 143 286 464 Cash and cash equivalents 5,062 6,246 3,618 Short-term debt 182 589 955 Total debt 22,565 21,662 21,725 Total equity 52,273 52,492 48,427 Percent of total debt to capital* 30 % 29 31 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 5 % 8 9 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. **Includes effect of interest rate swaps in 2013 and 2012. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2014 we received $1,603 million in proceeds from asset sales and issued $2,994 million of new low-interest notes. The primary uses of our available cash were $17,085 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $3,525 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $2,014 million to repay debt. During 2014 cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,184 million, to $5,062 million. In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital expenditures and investments, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2014 cash provided by continuing operating activities was $16,592 million, a 5 percent increase from 2013. Cash flows from operating activities benefited from the $1.3 billion distribution from FCCL in the first quarter of 2014. The distribution from FCCL resulted from our $2.8 billion prepayment of the remaining joint venture acquisition obligation in 2013, which substantially increased the financial flexibility of our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. We do not expect this individually significant distribution to recur in the future under current economic conditions. Cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the $0.5 billion payment of the fee resulting from our termination agreement with Freeport LNG, which was largely offset by the receipt of the Freeport LNG loan repayment. During 2013 cash provided by continuing operations was $15,801 million, compared with $13,458 million in 2012. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. During 2014 and 2013 we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 53 Table of Contents The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Our 2014 production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, averaged 1,532 MBOED. We expect 2015 production to grow 2 to 3 percent, excluding Libya. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2014 was 97 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 124 percent of 2014 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2014, our reserve replacement was 55 percent (including 78 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 138 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2014 were $1.6 billion, primarily from the sale of our Nigeria upstream affiliates for net proceeds of $1.4 billion, after customary adjustments, inclusive of deposits previously received. This compares with proceeds of $10.2 billion in 2013, primarily from the sale of our 8.4 percent equity interest in Kashagan, the sale of our Algeria business, the sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, the sale of our interest in the Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, the sale of our 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park and the sale of a portion of our working interest in Browse and Canning basins. For additional information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations and Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In June 2014 we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total of $7.5 billion to $7.0 billion, with a new expiration date of June 2019. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, for the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. 54 Table of Contents Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.1 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $900 million commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $860 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2014, compared with $961 million at December 31, 2013. Since we had $860 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.1 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014. Our senior long-term debt is rated A1 by Moody Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poor Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.0 billion revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had direct bank letters of credit of $802 million and $827 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 11 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2014, was $22.6 billion, an increase of $903 million from the balance at December 31, 2013. Our short-term debt balance at December 31, 2014, decreased $407 million compared with December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled maturities. During 2014 we repaid notes at maturity totaling $400 million. In November 2014 we redeemed the outstanding $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due January 2015 and issued $3.0 billion of new low-interest notes. For more information, see Note 10 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. In December 2013 we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. 55 Table of Contents In October 2014 we announced a dividend of 73 cents per share. The dividend was paid December 1, 2014, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2014. Additionally, on February 4, 2015, we announced a dividend of 73 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March 2, 2015, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2015. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2014: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to 1 Years Years After Total Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 21,707 123 2,309 3,843 15,432 Capital lease obligations (b) 858 59 95 102 602 Total debt 22,565 182 2,404 3,945 16,034 Interest on debt and other obligations 16,007 1,169 2,216 1,943 10,679 Operating lease obligations (c) 2,949 568 1,235 515 631 Purchase obligations (d) 17,450 7,099 3,119 1,878 5,354 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 1,690 294 558 838 - Asset retirement obligations (f) 10,939 592 1,506 1,529 7,312 Accrued environmental costs (g) 344 48 59 34 203 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 53 53 (h ) (h ) (h) Total $ 71,997 10,005 11,097 10,682 40,213 (a) Includes $372 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 10 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis. (c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $6,573 million. Purchase obligations of $7,778 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2015 through 2019. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2019, see Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 Table of Contents (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $389 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Spending Millions of Dollars 2014 2013 2012 Alaska $ 1,564 1,140 828 Lower 48 6,054 5,210 5,249 Canada 2,340 2,232 2,184 Europe 2,521 3,078 2,844 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,877 3,382 2,430 Other International 539 313 433 Corporate and Other 190 182 204 Capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations 17,085 15,537 14,172 Discontinued operations in Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria 59 609 817 Joint venture acquisition obligation (principal) Canada* - 772 733 Capital Program $ 17,144 16,918 15,722 *Excludes $2,810 million prepayment in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, totaled $46.8 billion. The 2014 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: Oil and natural gas development and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara shale plays, and the Permian Basin. Development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. Oil sands development and ongoing liquids-rich plays in Canada. In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Aasta Hansteen, Clair Ridge and Jasmine areas, and appraisal activities in the Greater Clair Area. Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area and the Greater Prudhoe Area, as well as exploration and development activities in the Western North Slope. Exploration and appraisal drilling in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Continued development in Malaysia and Indonesia and ongoing exploration, appraisal and development activity offshore Australia and China. Exploration activities in Angola and Senegal. 57 Table of Contents 2015 CAPITAL BUDGET In anticipation of weak commodity prices in 2015, our capital budget was further reduced in January 2015 from the previously announced $13.5 billion to $11.5 billion, a decrease of 33 percent, compared with our actual 2014 capital spend of $17.1 billion. The reduction in capital relative to 2014 primarily reflects deferral of spending on North American unconventional plays, as well as lower spending on major projects, several of which are nearing completion. We are planning to allocate approximately: 30 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. The 2015 Lower 48 development program capital will continue to target the Eagle Ford and Bakken, with investments being deferred in emerging plays like the Permian and Niobrara. We retain the flexibility to ramp up or down activity in the unconventionals. 40 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on completion of APLNG and Surmont 2, as well as multiple projects in Alaska, Europe and Malaysia. 15 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to exploration and appraisal. This spending will focus on conventional activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and Nova Scotia, as well as unconventional activity in North America. 15 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. 58 Table of Contents Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 18 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. 59 Table of Contents The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2013, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 15 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2014, there was no change in the number of sites. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $573 million in 2014 and are expected to be about $560 million per year in 2015 and 2016. Capitalized environmental costs were $497 million in 2014 and are expected to be about $450 million per year in 2015 and 2016. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). 60 Table of Contents Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2014, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $344 million, compared with $348 million at December 31, 2013, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2014 was approximately $3 million (net share pre-tax). A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July 1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2014 was approximately $6 million. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. The U.S. EPA announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA and U.S. Department of Transportation joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. 61 Table of Contents The U.S. EPA announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The current U.S. administration has established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2014 was approximately $41 million (net share pre-tax). Our cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation carbon tax (repealed in July 2014) in 2014 was approximately $3 million (net share pre-tax). In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). The GHG reductions required. The price and availability of offsets. The amount and allocation of allowances. Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. Reducing GHG emissions In 2013 the Company reduced or avoided GHG emissions by approximately 1,200,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. Engaging externally The Company is a sponsor of MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $7 to $47 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. 62 Table of Contents Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income. NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION: PRICE NORMALIZED CASH MARGIN PER BOE Our financial information includes information prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as non-GAAP information. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it enhances understanding of our consolidated financial information by facilitating comparisons of Company operating performance across time periods. This non-GAAP measure should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure in order not to imply more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. Cash margin is a performance measure we calculate as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income adjusted for the special items included in the following reconciliation; depreciation, depletion and amortization; dry hole costs; impairments; and corporate and other segment earnings. The denominator is production for the stated time period. This performance measure represents the amount of cash generated per BOE of production. Normalized for changes in commodity prices across time periods, changes in this performance measure demonstrate an underlying portfolio shift to liquids and more favorable fiscal regimes.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2014, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,275 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $433 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pre-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2015 would increase by approximately $22 million. At year-end 2014, the remaining $6,612 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $4 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2015. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 66 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2014, total suspended well costs were $1,299 million, compared with $994 million at year-end 2013. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the economic interest method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. 67 Table of Contents The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2014, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $64 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2014 was approximately $7.9 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2013 and 4.6 billion BOE at the end of 2014. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pre-tax DD&A in 2014 would have increased by an estimated $420 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 8 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal 68 Table of Contents costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,400 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. See Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 69 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
