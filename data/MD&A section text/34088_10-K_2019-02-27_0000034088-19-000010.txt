BUSINESS Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Their principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses. Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil , Exxon , Esso, Mobil or XTO . For convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO , as well as terms like Corporation , Company , our , we and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question. The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes. Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the following: Quarterly Information , Note 18: Disclosures about Segments and Related Information and Operating Information . Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the Oil and Gas Reserves part of the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities portion of the Financial Section of this report. ExxonMobil has a long standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments. ExxonMobil held nearly 13 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2018. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $119 million in 2018. Although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession. The number of regular employees was 71.0 thousand, 69.6 thousand, and 71.1 thousand at years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation benefit plans and programs. Throughout ExxonMobil businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil 2018 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil share of equity company expenditures, were $4.9 billion, of which $3.6 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $5.7 billion in 2019 and 2020. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total. Information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the Corporation business, the extent of seasonality in the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations may be found in Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS ExxonMobil financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the Company control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include: Supply and Demand The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company operations, especially in the Upstream segment, financial condition, and proved reserves. On the other hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company operations, especially in the Downstream and Chemical segments. Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil. Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources; changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation or increased consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric vehicles; and broad-based changes in personal income levels. Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by countries to OPEC production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals. Other market factors. ExxonMobil business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. Government and Political Factors ExxonMobil results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations. Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin. Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United States or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or may be unable to maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award. 2 Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal systems where ExxonMobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law (including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that could adversely affect our results, such as: increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims); price controls; changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling operations, water use, methane emissions, hydraulic fracturing or plastics); adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components; adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries; and government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets. Legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate. We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time. Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such policies could make our products more expensive, less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions. Government sponsorship of alternative energy. Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research both in-house and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, The University of Texas, and Stanford University. Our research projects focus on developing algae-based biofuels, carbon capture and storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials, and other technologies. For example, ExxonMobil is working with Fuel Cell Energy Inc. to explore using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture CO 2 emissions from gas-fired power plants. Our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See Operational and Other Factors below. Operational and Other Factors In addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control. Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget. 3 Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses depends on complex, long term, capital intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including diversification among types and locations of our projects. The term project as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil competitive performance, especially given the commodity based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees. Research and development and technological change. To maintain our competitive position, especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies. Safety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities. We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended. Cybersecurity. ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including state-sponsored actors. ExxonMobil defensive preparedness includes multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions; non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups; internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery. If the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient, ExxonMobil as well as our customers, employees, or third parties could be adversely affected. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions, litigation or reputational harm. Preparedness. Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning. 4 Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this Item 1A is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient. Competition. As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. We face competition not only from other private firms, but also from state-owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries. In some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil or reduce the need for resource-owning countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources. Reputation. Our reputation is an important corporate asset. An operating incident, significant cybersecurity disruption, or other adverse event such as those described in this Item 1A may have a negative impact on our reputation, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products. ExxonMobil reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole. Projections, estimates, and descriptions of ExxonMobil plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7 and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs, and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 5 Item 2. Properties Information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows: 1. Disclosure of Reserves A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2018 The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels. The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2018, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation capital spending and also impact our partners capacity to fund their share of joint projects. B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2018 Additions to ExxonMobil proved reserves in 2018 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages. In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the Global Reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering and currently serves on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either Engineering or Geology. The Global Reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement. 7 2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves At year-end 2018, approximately 7.9 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. This represents 32 percent of the 24.3 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to the 7.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2017. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 0.8 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. The largest transfers were related to drilling activity in the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, and Russia. During 2018, extensions and discoveries, primarily in the United States resulted in an addition of approximately 1.7 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Also, the Corporation reclassified approximately 0.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the SEC definition of proved reserves, primarily in the Netherlands at the Groningen gas field and the United States. Overall, investments of $13.2 billion were made by the Corporation during 2018 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $13.1 billion for oil and gas producing activities and additional investments for other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments represented 65 percent of the $20.2 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. One of ExxonMobil requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Canada, proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore Hebron field and onshore Cold Lake operations. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the producing offshore Kashagan field which is included in the North Caspian Production Sharing Agreement and the Tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the Tengiz Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. 8 3.

Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2018, the company share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 60 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit. Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit. Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2018, average net production at Kearl was about 191 thousand barrels per day. At year-end 2018, an additional 3.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl qualified as proved reserves under the SEC definition requiring calculations based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price during the last 12-month period. 5.

The terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are property specific, contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. 19 D. Summary of Acreage Terms UNITED STATES Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a fee interest is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright. CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS Canada Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a maximum term of nine years. Offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term. Argentina The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in December 2014. The onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an optional extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area. Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional production concession would be 25 years, and 35 years for an unconventional concession, with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. Guyana The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act authorizes the government of Guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years with a production period of 20 years with a 10 year extension. EUROPE Germany Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license. Netherlands Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law. Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years. Norway Licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of the initial period. Licenses issued after July 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of the initial period. 20 United Kingdom Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term. Terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged areas are governed by frontier production licenses, generally covering a larger initial area than traditional licenses, with an initial exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six years, and a final production term of 18 years, with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after three years and 50 percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years. Innovate licenses issued replace traditional and frontier licenses and offer greater flexibility with respect to periods and work program commitments. AFRICA Angola Exploration and production activities are governed by production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years and an optional second phase of two to three years. The production period is 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension. Chad Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050. Equatorial Guinea Exploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. A new PSC was ratified in 2018; the initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year extensions available at the discretion of the Ministry and limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. The production period for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25 to 50 years. Mozambique Exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the Government of the Republic of Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development for a given discovery area. In 2018 an interest was acquired in offshore blocks, A5-B, Z5-C and Z5-D. Terms for the three blocks are governed by their respective EPCCs, which have an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 with the possibility of two additional exploration phases expiring in 2024 and 2025. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development. Nigeria Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended. Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years, while in all other areas the licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML. 21 OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further renewal option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a joint venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act. OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months written notice, for another period of 20 years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration. ASIA Azerbaijan The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field was established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049. Other exploration and production activities are governed by PSAs negotiated with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The exploration period typically consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to three-year extension. The production period, which includes development, is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year extensions. Indonesia Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. In 2012, Indonesia Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to BPMIGAS to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry of the Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require the contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50 percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending on the acreage and terms. Iraq Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels. Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for five years, with extensions available as provided by the PSCs and at the discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. Current PSCs remain in effect by agreement of the regional government to allow additional time for exploration or evaluation of commerciality. The production period is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. Kazakhstan Onshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993. Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two ten-year extensions. Malaysia Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have exploration and production terms ranging up to 38 years. All extensions are subject to the national oil company prior written approval. The production periods range from 15 to 29 years, depending on the provisions of the respective contract. 22 Qatar The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects. Russia Terms for ExxonMobil Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the current production sharing agreement (PSA) between the Russian government and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator. ExxonMobil withdrew from the joint ventures with Rosneft for the Kara, Laptev, Chukchi and Black Seas, effective April 30, 2018. ExxonMobil continues to remain in compliance with all laws applicable to its operations and investments in the Russian Federation. Thailand The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms generally prevalent at the time. The term of the concession expires in 2021. United Arab Emirates An interest in the development and production activities of the Upper Zakum field, a major offshore field, was acquired in 2006. In 2017 the governing agreements were extended to 2051. AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA Australia Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter indefinitely , i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely . In each case, a production license may be terminated if no production operations have been carried on for five years. Papua New Guinea Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum Prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum Development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister discretion. Petroleum Retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum Retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be extended, at the Minister discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of 15 years. Extensions of Petroleum Retention licenses may be for periods of less than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years. 23 Information with regard to the Downstream segment follows: ExxonMobil Downstream segment manufactures, trades and sells petroleum products.

Legal Proceedings In a matter reported in the Corporation Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2018, the State of Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil & Gas Resources Management (ODNR) and XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) signed a Compliance Agreement on December 21, 2018, regarding alleged violations by XTO of the Ohio Revised Code, Ohio Administrative Code, and implementing regulations arising out of the Schnegg well incident in Belmont County, Ohio, in early 2018. The Compliance Agreement settles the following alleged actions of XTO: (1) causing brine to be discharged and contact the ground and/or surface water; (2) failure to place cement in the casing string per Ohio codes; (3) allowing a well to flow gas uncontrolled; (4) failure to construct, drill and operate a well in the manner as permitted and planned; and (5) failure to notify the ODNR upon discovery a well had sustained annular pressure above the prescribed pressure. The penalty assessment was $850,000, half paid to the ODNR on January 15, 2019, and half to be paid to 29 agencies located in Belmont County as designated by the ODNR. In another matter relating to the Schnegg well incident, reported in the Corporation Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2018, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) and XTO signed Final Findings and Orders on December 28, 2018, regarding OEPA allegations that XTO violated the Ohio Revised Code and implementing regulations, including but not limited to: (1) failure to maintain and operate its facility in a manner using good pollution control practices; (2) failure to provide a malfunction report; (3) failure to complete and properly report quarterly inspections; and (4) failure to submit site-specific work practice plans within applicable time limits. The penalty assessment of $150,000 was paid on January 21, 2019, half to the OEPA and half to a Supplemental Environmental Project. As reported in the Corporation Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018, the Corporation received a proposed agreed order from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), dated March 15, 2018, related to routine Title V air operating permit investigations conducted by the TCEQ in 2017 of the Baytown Refinery in Texas. The proposed agreed order alleged that the refinery failed to authorize, monitor, or keep records on certain equipment and to comply with certain flare or fuel gas monitoring system availability requirements or concentration limits. After receipt of additional information from ExxonMobil and further evaluation of the alleged violations, the TCEQ has issued a revised proposed agreed order, reducing the number of alleged violations and agreeing to an administrative penalty of $56,596 in settlement of these matters. The Agreed Order was signed by ExxonMobil on December 18, 2018, and ExxonMobil paid $28,298 on January 10, 2019. The balance will be paid to a Supplemental Environmental Project upon endorsement by the TCEQ. As last reported in the Corporation Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2018, on July 20, 2017, the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) assessed a civil penalty against Exxon Mobil Corporation, ExxonMobil Development Company and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for violating the Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 589. The assessed civil penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have been and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any violation has occurred. ExxonMobil and its affiliates filed a complaint on July 20, 2017, in the United States Federal District Court, Northern District of Texas seeking judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the Administrative Procedures Act and the United States Constitution, including on the basis that it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by OFAC and a violation of the Company due process rights. Refer to the relevant portions of Note 16: Litigation and Other Contingencies of the Financial Section of this report for additional information on legal proceedings. Item 4.
